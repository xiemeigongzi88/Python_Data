Data source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data

## Target:
	By visualizing, summarizing and interpreting the information that is hidden in rows and column format, this data analysis project allows us to achieve certain insights and statistical measure that is essential. 

## Steps:
	 Data downloading and transforming by using the requests library to parse url from data source in Python.
   
	 Exploratory data analysis with Pandas and Numpy. What we can obtain: Top 10 male and female names; Top 20 gender neutral names;  highest and lowest years.
   
	 Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Data visualizations make big and small data easier for the human brain to understand, and visualization also makes it easier to detect patterns, trends, and outliers in groups of data. What we can obtain: baby names records per year; Top 10 names growth; Top 10 trending names. 

## Conclusion: 
	I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project https://github.com/PhantomInsights/baby-names-analysis.
