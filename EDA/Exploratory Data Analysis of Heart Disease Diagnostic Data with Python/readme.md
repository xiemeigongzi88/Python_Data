#  Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease UCI  
https://github.com/xiemeigongzi88/Python_Data/tree/master/EDA/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20of%20Heart%20Disease%20Diagnostic%20Data%20with%20Python

Dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

## Target: 
This dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. 
What we must pay attention to is the column.
Age： age in years
Sex： (1 = male; 0 = female)
Cp： chest pain type
Trestbps：resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
Chol： serum cholestoral in mg/dl
Fbs： (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
Restecg：resting electrocardiographic results
Thalach：maximum heart rate achieved
Exang：exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
Oldpeak：ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope：the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Ca：number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
Thal：3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
Target：1 or 0

## What we can obtain from this EDA:
Excess weight, especially around the stomach area, increases a woman's risk of developing cardiovascular disease and lack of physical activity makes it worse.
Diabetes causes damage to blood vessels so diabetes is a major factor in developing cardiovascular disease.
Unhealthy foods, lack of exercise, lead to heart disease. So can high blood pressure, infections, and birth defects.
Smoking is one of the biggest causes of cardiovascular disease.
Just a few cigarettes a day can damage the blood vessels and reduce the amount of oxygen available in our blood.
But other things might surprise you.

## Conclusion: 
	I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “With a Healthy Heart the Beat Goes On” https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshjnv/heart-disease-exploration-ml-prediction
