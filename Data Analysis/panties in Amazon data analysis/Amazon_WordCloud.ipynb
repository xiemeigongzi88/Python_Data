       "' First off, male user here. I have purchased all the colors offered and other sofishie panties and these are by far my favorite. The fit is perfect, I ordered medium and I have a 32” waist. I love the quality, how they feel and how they make my ass look. Totally recommend.Sexy look, but didn’t notice the brand until she shouted it from the bathroom, LOL. Whoever named this product had one job and failed miserably! Hahahaha “So fishie” isn’t exactly a thought you wanna associate with women’s undies. Just saying......These are really cute and sexy. I wouldn’t wear them every day but as a sexy date night panty they work well. The lace is elastic-y and feels like it could rip with rough handling, but I’m not sure what else you’d expect with all over lace panties.I have a 32” waist and 45” hips. I wear 12/14 jeans and the large fits but is just a bit too tight. An XL might fit a little better, but I have a similar pair from the same brand and the XL is just on the loose side.The shape of these panties is very flattering, though they gap in a strange place because the criss-cross in the back is a teensy bit loose. They\\'re awkward to keep up, but I like the way they look and the price was too good to resist. Boyfriend loves \\'em, of course.I ordered the small no we’re did it day runs big or give a number size to match they were very big more like at least a medium wanted them for a trip so was disappointedThese panties are so beautiful! However I wear a small and ordered a small and this was definitely more a m or a m/l. I’m sure that one of my friends with a bugger butt than me we will enjoy them when I gift it to themVery sexy and nice material. Was surprised it was a lil big.Product is really sexy but a lil on the big side.. Ordered a small and fits like a large.. Maybe for a lil bigger woman this product would fit niceGood ass-ortmentI’m kind of a Victoria Secret snob, but I took a chance and ordered the 20 pack of undies. One of my best purchases on Amazon to date! I received a variety of colors/materials and they honestly exceeded my expectations. There are only a few pair that I’m not crazy about, but that’s pretty good for not having personally selected them. For reference I ordered a L, I’m 5’7” and around 180 lbs (hourglass) and I wear a size 10 jean.Some of the numeric sizing is weird on the tags, but like the description says, just ignore that! They all seem to be about the same size. Will purchase again! (Pics included)I’m 5’5, 125lbs. I wear a 4/5 pants which is pretty much a halfway size (Small is too tight and Medium is too big). I ordered panty size Small and probably should have ordered a medium but I’m happy with my purchase. They’re adorable and I plan to purchase again.I bought these items based almost entirely on the positive reviews, so it only seemed fair to leave my own :) I received my panties (11 pairs) promptly, and they arrived neatly laid out in a reusable plastic pouch. All of my pairs were thongs or g-strings; unlike other reviewers I received no boy shorts or bikinis. Every pair was sized well (I ordered up to a 2xl, or a 9, from my usual 8), even a little loose on a pair or two. The seller is definitely paying attention to actual, not just listed size.I purchased these mainly because hubby had a sudden desire to see more g\\'s, after a decade of liking other styles. And this order didn\\'t disappoint. I liked 10/11 pairs, and even the last pair was cute, just a little bright for me. There\\'s a pair of really lovely black lace g\\'s, a couple of matching lace thongs (different colors, same panties), an adorable see-through pair of white with black butterflies, and several other cute lacey pairs.I will absolutely order this pack again, maybe even trying different styles.Thanks to the seller for the great variety and fit!I am a big girl. I’m 5’4 and weigh 215. I ordered extra large and they were pretty big. I could have gotten away with a large. But the variety and quality, I absolutely loved!!! So many pretty colors and different styles. I got 2 duplicates but I don’t mind at all.Definitely a wide variety of patterns colors and styles the second picture shows you this. There is everything from real G string to cuts with really thick band along the waist. There are two other pair is not pictured here that I have already worn and I really comfortable there’s only a few duplicates of patterns but they’re in different colors with white pinstripe gray and pink.  I am 56 and weigh 140-145 pounds (usually size 5-6 in hips/jeans) I got the medium package because I figured it was the best gamble after reading the reviews and I was right. Some of them do look like they will fit a bit larger around the band then others but so far so good. All of them have great stretch (I hate it when some underwear doesn’t stretch at all).  Great way to revamp your indie drawer! Overall good purchase would consider doing again and I recommend.I usually shop VS\\'s \"buy 5 for 30 bucks\" deals, but they\\'re admittedly pretty costly and as the years go by, & I\\'m having more and more trouble finding styles I even like! After hopping on amazon to see what deals there are - I found some good reviews and gave this a shot. It came to my house pretty quickly, and everything fit! Some are boring, a few were sexy, some were fun patterns, and 2 of the pairs I didn\\'t really care for the style of - but overall I was really happy with this! What a great deal! No \"mold/mildew\" smell that some people have previously reported. I\\'ll definitely be ordering again!I\\'m 5\\'6, and about 135 lbs and a medium fit just right. Not too snug, not too loose.I got my package on time. There were exactly as many pairs as I ordered. They were all different colors and styles of thongs. Since they were all different brands of undies, some of them fit me a little larger, some a little smaller. But overall, they all fit me well enough and they look cute! I definitely recommend this. I like that I got several pairs in colors and styles that I normally may have not picked out for myself, but when I tried them on they looked cute! The only reason I gave it four stars is because not everything fit PERFECTLY, but I mean, that is the nature of this sort of \"grab bag\" style of item. Overall, I think it is a fantastic price for what you receive and I highly recommend it. I\\'ve already told several of my friends about it!Cute and sexy, but definitely not for everyday wear. The lace is flimsy and feels like it’ll tear if you’re too rough. Regardless, the straps are flattering and still look cute on my chubby stomach.I’m 5’3” 170 lbs. I wear a 12-14 pants and the extra large looks good but had a loose fit, a large may have been better.Bought these for a “panty raffle” kind of game for a bachelorette party and they won! They were so cute and everyone was asking where I bought them from.Very cute. Fit a little strange. Bottom lace was great but the top strappy part is slightly tight. I also felt like it extended high on my waist. Like a high waisted cut which I don\\'t like. Still very cute and comfy for the most part.This item was received so quickly, was exactly as described in the ad and was a great deal.  Would definitely recommend ordering from this seller to our friends.These are fantastic! I\\'ve bought tons of Sofishie underwear and love every pair I\\'ve had so far and these are no different! Sexy designs, comfortable material, great cost! It doesn\\'t get much better!Quality product and sexySuper cute!!Product came in and looked exactly like it was pictured, my wife absolutely loved them and she said that they fit and feel amazing, better then any Victoria\\'s secret pair she has owned. 10/10 would highly recommend.I ordered these without knowing what to expect after the September 15th size correction update listed in the description. With the hopes that this will help someone else: according to the size chart posted, I *should* have ordered an extra large. To me, that felt silly becuase I would normally go straight for a medium. I took a chance and purchased the large, which is only supposed to fit up to a 27 inch waist (very skewed, but ok). My hip circumference is 39 inches around the biggest part of my butt, and the size large are super comfortable- they fit perfectly without stretching at all. I probably could have ordered the medium and been fine since these do stretch, but I have experienced no rolling or falling down or anything so I am happy. I was also worried that the lace back would show up under some of my work pants, but that is not the case at all. Even with body hugging outfits you can\\'t see these, plus they\\'re cute and I really liked the color variety. This is a steal compared to the 20-30 dollar a pair underwear you see in department stores (btw, when the heck did undies get so dang expensive?). Overall I am very happy, but I do think the size chart should be updated to make the sizing less confusing.The sizing runs a little smaller as what other people have mentioned.  My wife is usually a Medium and I looked at what other said and I decided to go with a large and they are absolutely spot on.  I told my wife that I saw reviews on them running smaller so that\\'s why I went with a large.  I didn\\'t want a backhand for thinking she was getting bigger.  Overall, the quality, design and feel are great.  She does like them.These panties are worthy of 5/5 stars IF I were only judging fit and looks. If you follow the manufacturer’s sizing chart, (not Amazon’s) then you will be pleasantly surprised. I ordered manufacturer’s size M which is equivalent to a US size S. Your waistline for this size should be between 22.0 - 27.5 in. For reference, I’m a size 2 with narrow hips and a very small booty. As far as looks, I dislike full bottom panties but these are really pretty and I don’t feel like I have a bunch of fabric getting ready to target and hike up in to my crack.I took off one star because while the back of these lacy beauty’s are completely seamless under clothes (if you get the right size), the front is a different situation. The fabric is thick and double-lined with reverse stitching. So, the seams are sewn on the inside which creates an unflattering, bulky outline through fitted clothes. That makes the whole point of these ‘seamless’ panties counter productive.Overall, I don’t regret this purchase and these panties will work just fine under flowy dresses/skirts and loose fitting pants. Hope this review helps.The cut and look of these are great.  They are soft and appeared to be made ok (not cheaply made, but not well made either). The sizing is way off, but I thankfully read previous reviews and decided to take heed of their warnings.  I am 5\\' 6.5\", 130 pounds, wear size 4 pants, but have a little \\'junk in the trunk\\' in terms of body shape.  Usually, I wear a size small underwear, or maybe an occasional medium, depending on the brand.  I ordered an xlarge and they fit perfectly - which is quite shocking.  So, my advice is order about 2 sizes bigger than you normally would.quality is just fine, the material is soft though I can see the elastic will soon give out. That said the sizing is totally off. I\\'m a size 6 and ordered a Medium. They sent me a large instead. The LARGE was too small. Not on the waist but more on the front \"coverage\" of the front area. This is very very low cut. I need to order XL.I would usually get a medium (hips 39\", waist 30\", 5\\'6\",150 lbs) but I followed others and ordered two sizes up and got XL. They fit perfectly, as in: the fabric isn\\'t stretched tight, pinching, or creating a visible dent in my skin at all, they\\'re just right. I\\'d say even a bit roomy. They lay perfectly flat and feel good. I read somewhere that some people found the lace too scratchy, but I honestly don\\'t. Its not as fine as some other panties I have, but it\\'s comfortable and smooth. The colors are really vibrant. One tip: cut all the size-tags out immediately, they\\'re made from the worst, scratchy, paper tag material and they\\'re huge and visible otherwise. Other than that, these are a good deal!I haven\\'t washed them enough to know how they\\'ll last but I\\'m loving them so far! Very comfortable and no pantie lines! Love the sexy feeling these give, without the uncomfortable feeling of a thong. Colors are true to online. I echo what other reviews say, order up in size.Surprisingly very good quality. I ordered a medium based on other reviews and they fit well. It says its a large even though I ordered a medium on the tag. I thought they sent the wrong size, but they have a little note in there that explains the sizing chart. So don\\'t be alarmed if the tag is not what you ordered. Very sexy and I love all the different colors.These are hilarious! They don\\'t actually fit over the butts though, we tried. lolI am returning....this was a fun gift for a bachelorette party and this came with no box and was really cheap poor quality.  Not worth it.This came out of the box. Buyer beware - it doesn\\'t look good buying novelty underwear that didn\\'t come in a box.I had to print out an add and include in the gift so people knew what it was. I also super washed the unboxed undies. Thank god it was a gag joke and not something the bride would have worn.I honestly bought this item because I was curious. There is literally no reason why anyone would need a 4-holed- underwear, but I bought it for the sake of laughs and giggles for Valentine\\'s Day. The material is good and it hasn\\'t ripped so I guess it\\'s a win-win!These were for a gag gift for a bachelorette party.  They were pretty cheaply made.  And I specifically paid a few dollars more and purchased this pair b/c they were advertised in a box with funny images of people wearing them.  But they didn\\'t come in a box, just a clear plastic bag.  I wasn\\'t very impressed, but for a gag gift it was OK.The whole purpose of this is for fun.  Get laughter when people see the picture on the package. Well, there was no package.  Giving this as a gag gift is met with confusion, nobody knows what it is.  Ok product, but useless without packaging and picture.I think these are great. My partner and I were both able to fit in them and conduct some physical activity and not once had a rip or tear. They held up just fine. And we were able to pull them up all the way. The fabric really does have a lot of stretch it in it. If you like it kinky, go for these.This was a huge hit at my best friends bachelorette party, it was HILARIOUS!I absolutely love these! I\\'m normally a US size medium but I went with a large and they fit perfectly! I highly recommend these! Great quality material! And super cute on!DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! They LOOK beautiful, but the lace is STIFF and it actually stretched out on a skinny person!! (5\\'9\" 117 lbs. waist 27, mid hips 33, lower hips 34.5) I am SO DISAPPOINTED considering I would have found better at WALMARTThese are very cute and fit perfectly. My wife has been looking for a pair that she can wear that doesn\\'t run too small and this was it! So thankful we found this. Will be buying more.Was a little weird to order panties that were going to have a tag that says so fishy on it but man am I glad I did!  These are the softest lace that fits perfectly. Nothing rolls or bunches so you can actually see the scallops. All lace boyshorts I\\'ve had before were scratchy at best and caused so much sweat that I never felt very sexy wearing them. I wear these to work almost every day!Definitely will be trying out some other styles from this brand.These are so prettySo I’m a medium size usually all around.  I’m not very large from behind so I got a medium and it was too small. I recommend large even if ur behind isn’t that big like mineGirlfriend says they fit great and have lasted through a bunch of washes.Fish net material not lace. The crotch is nylon. Yuck!My husband has never cared for lingerie and usually doesn’t bat an eye at new panties but I walked into the living room to show him and he chased me back into our bedroom so quickly. I’ve been struggling with not feeling so sexy since having my first child 6 months ago but these hug my curves so well and compliment my booty I felt so good putting them on for the first time. The colors are also very nice and mature. I hate finding underwear that have cute details but ugly neon prints all over them.Very soft, super comfy, fits true to size and doesnt dig into my hips. Feels like I\\'m wearing nothing. I\\'m a size 12/14 at torrid and a size 16 at Charlotte Russell and the xl/xxl fits great. My only complaint is that the strip that overs your lady bits could be a half inch to an inch wider but it doesnt bug me as is.Very fast shipping they are very soft fabric and they fit great. Very sexy my husband loves them.I was hesitant due to other reviews but I’m not upset with these underwear.. I have wider hips so I upsized and I’m glad I did except for the fact that doing so made the crotch area longer than I wanted but not too bad.. a simple fix with some thread if it becomes annoying.. other than that the lace is on the thinner side so I’m not expecting these to last long.. but for 15$ they’re not terrible!Fit my wife perfectly, and they don\\'t leave any marks on her skin, and this is after multiple washesThese are really comfortable and look cute on. In the past when I’ve ordered panties on amazon they’ve always been too small so I played it safe and ordered a large but they’re too big. I’m 5’8”, 150 and plan on ordering these again in a medium.These are very comfortable. The material is very soft. They have a cute little criss-cross design above the thong.  You don\\'t feel the thong when you are walking. The pack comes in four different colors. I pretty much wear a different pair everyday.I felt it was very durable stretchy lace very soft fit as expected... Well honestly I thought it may be a bit small you know how that goes but they fit great I love itThese are great!!! I\\'m 5\\'5 and 160.. I normally wear a large and I ordered up a size. The XL fits fine but they\\'re a little loose. Ordering more in a L. I\\'m always worried when I order things online, especially like this. I\\'ve found things aren\\'t usually very stretchy and don\\'t fit comfortably. These do!! Will be buying more!!I\\'m 5\\'6 and 110 pounds, size small fit perfect. They appear to be of decent quality and are very pretty. They will make your bum look like a present!These were odd.  When I got them to fit where they should they just dug into my skin and pinched.  I would order a few sizes up if you choose to order these because they are really tight and binding.  I would not recommend them or order them again if you are a curvy girl like me.  You have toCute as heck, falls apart after wearing for a day. I’d say hand wash only but they were falling apart before that even.Let’s be honest you’re not buying cheap lingerie on amazon for its quality.If you need a pair that are sexy but you don’t care if they get ripped off of you, perfect. Don’t spend more than 5 bucks tho.If you wanna look cute for more than a day or two go to a store and find something that’s actually well made. And not sold by the least morally sound retailer on earth.Super cute! For the price these are really good quality. And make my bum look really good. My boyfriend is going to love them. I’ll definitely buy again!!I am 5’7” and weigh about 135 lbs. I got a small. I was initially skeptical to buy underwear off Amazon, but these are amazing! They fit perfectly, have a nice quality, and, most importantly, they look amazing! I definitely recommend and would 10/10 buy again.I did order the next size up because I didn\\'t want the underwear riding up on me.  It worked out that I did that.Very delicate.  Husband loves.  Would recommend washing by hand or in a mesh garment bag!I honestly never write reviews but I felt obligated to write one for this order because I have a striking suspicion most of the good reviews are either fake or happend to be a by luck. I ordered the 24 pair package in a size small and honestly... it doesn’t matter what size you pick because they put everything from smalls to extra large in my order. I don’t see the point of sending me underwear that is large when clearly I can’t wear them. Also some of the underwear I received is really a really weird style... like 80s high waisted thongs. I will only be keeping about 4 pairs, and I am not fond of the quality. All of the undies also REEK of fabric dye or toxic fumes, and if this smell doesn’t go away after I wash them I’ll be tossing all of them out. The quality of the underwear I received is definitely not what I expected so if you’re someone who usually buys VS underwear... you will be wasting your money on this order. I’ve only worn VS cotton panties since I was a teen and although they are pricey, I am realizing they are so worth it.First off 20 panties for like $25 isn’t bad... whatever the price was. I received 21 as well as some other reviewers did.I ordered small.. I’m 5ft and about 110lbs if that helps any.I guess I over looked that it’s a mixed style of thongs to granny panties.. The item and picture describe just thongs, but when you ACTUALLY READ THE READ DESCRIPTION — it clear as day explains what’s included...With that being said there was truly only one panty that was TOO FREAKING HUGE.It was the peach one I labeled as size comparison in the photos. Like ?? Why’s the crotch so freaking long... must be what one of the reviewers were talking about. I mean I’d literally have to wear this thing at my belly button if not higher — it just isn’t logical.The lavender g string on top of the peach panties are from Walmart — because I actually once purchased them 😂 so that was weird to see in this purchase.Also a couple are from target. The exhilaration tag were still on a few of them. It’s like they cut off just the letter size but not always the entire label off. I don’t get it.Thankfully I only got two granny panties and shockingly enough they both fit 😂 but I have no intention of wearing them... like ever.There’s like some bikini/boy short/cheeky (whatever style it’s called) assorted in the lot as well. They’re okay. They fit well. It’s just they look big when you compare them to a skimpy thong but they’ll be fine. I just don’t think I’ll wear them either because they’ll literally just go up my butt anyway and who really wants to be picking that out — not I, Bahah.Also I saw some people saying how their thongs got ripped or whatever from the tags being cut too close to the stitching or pulled out of the seams  ... I didn’t have any issues like that thankfully.Over all I’d buy again. I did not notice a chemical/dye odor either.I just wish I had more colored thongs/g strings like everyone else.I feel like I got the last of the ugly... like everyone got the cute thongs and I just got the crappy left overs before their new shipment came in or however they acquire their panties. My luck.Hope this review helped you!I read the reviews so I knew that this was very much a random grab bag.So I got 3 non-thong pairs of panties; which Im not upset about. They were all cute.Then there are the 3 thongs that do not fit at all (gray, black, and tan)Lastly there are the 5 thongs that do fit and I am very happy with. The cutest pair are the white and red pair!!!So all in all; Im not disappointed and might buy again; just for the fun of getting a random assortment.But if you are looking for only thongs that are all the same exact size; this might not be the product for you.Since buying “grab bag” underpants can be a gamble, and since I read so many reviews before purchase I felt obligated to write a review. I am pleased with my purchase. Yes, some items in my “small” bag were XL, but they are the same size as my S and XS - I am honestly thinking these may be Asian sizes as they run notoriously small and it’d make sense that my size 0 butt would be a L/XL. I got only 1 truly atrocious pair, most are thongs - even the bikinis are still “cute” underwear and not “period panties”, there was no smell (another review mentioned one), and only one pair started to fray in the wash (my first stop, after opening of course). For $1.25/pair this deal can’t be beat. Sure it’ll be luck of the draw as to whether you get things that are your style, but hey, if you’re gonna start to be brave about colors and patterns, where better to start that an article of clothing that isn’t publicly seen? Get your mind set that it’s a mystery gift and you’ll be fine!  Next year at that magical “panty drawer cleaning” time I would absolutely order again.Wonderful price and variety. Great quality, my boyfriend was very pleased with my new underwear. Took some time to arrive but it was worth it.  Completely redid my underwear drawer.After reading so many mixed reviews, I wasn\\'t sure what I was getting into. I told a friend who\\'s bigger than me that if she wanted she could have the pairs that don\\'t fit. Although they all the size that I asked for. A lot of the tags are missing for what reason I don\\'t know but I really don\\'t like tags in panties so it\\'s not a downfall at all. Some of them are g strings, thongs, boyshorts, bikini style and I really like the variety as well as the variety of materials and that none of them are the same.Love this thong set! The colors are really fun and the style looks great. One bow cane off one pair, but no biggie.These are the best undies I’ve bought off Amazon. I purchased the Medium size. I am 5’1 at 140 lbs and the medium fit perfectly. They are stretchy enough and would fit well even if you have a huge tushy. They are also high quality, not at all the cheap pair I was expecting. They are so soft and comfortable to wear. Highly recommend these! Buying some more myself.These are really nice and very pretty, I ordered a size up based on reviews, but my normal small would have fit me better. I am 5\\'7\", 127lbs!I absolutely love the fabric, it is so soft but cool to the touch. Very durable for the price, as I have washed in the washer without lace tearing and the ribbons falling off and stuff. I did hang dry to avoid any damage to the elastic. Perfect cut for petite frame instead of having a bunch of extra fabric in the crotch area like I have with some. Fabric is stretchy so they fit snug but comfortably.These are cuter in person! I\\'m not sure what size they pictured on the mannequin, but the ones that I ordered are much lower riding than in the pictures. I am a 0-1 normally and am 5\\'5\" and 110 lbs. and I ordered these in small.They’re really cute and they fit me perfectly. I thought they would look cheap because of the price but not at all! Amazing quality and they look exactly like in the pictures! I can’t wait to show my boyfriend.I love these very much. Made for comfy wear, at home or outside. A nice addition to my panty drawer.Sexy, stunning m, look just like the photos sizr was perfectWay better than I thought for the price.More adjustable than you would think...Look and feel nice.They get tugged on real hard and don’t rip so that’s cool for a throw away price tag!Fits so good, absolutely love it! I ordered a large and it’s extremely comfortable. I am 5’9 180 pounds and curvy.I got a size XL for my US women\\'s size 14, panties size 8, 33 in waist and 44 in hips. This is a *little* tricky to get into without ripping, but it still fits. I can wear the straps up high on my waist to make the pentagram shape. Very nice.Cool addition to the strappy/sassy underware department. She is a size 8 (about 30 waist I think) and medium fit.Love it! I wore this with my body cage for a photo shoot. My photographer loved it. Fits great.Besides the front fabric being a bit scratchy, these fit great! I\\'m 90lb and 5\\' so I\\'m always afraid things will be too big, but all the straps adjust so it fit perfectThe style and fit were PERFECT! Made my backside look incredible! The issue lies in the small patch that covers the front. The material is as coarse as sandpaper & the mesh is cheaply put together! I\\'m going to line mine with dark cotton to make it wearable. Would only recommend to put on as soon as your ready to show them & take them off.Had to swap hands with top strap when it doesnt fit right. Took her a bit. LolSomeone took a lace string and sewed it together pretending was underwear fabric. Save yourself some money and use you left over ribbon from the holidays cause it’s pretty much the same thing. It also fell off the hips and I’d was a jumbled messes. Fits odd.These are garbage. I don’t know what size these are supposed to be, but I ordered a small and it’s more like an extra-large. Low-quality Chinese junk.Not as depicted at all, no gold rings, no elastic, no front mesh cover, all lace material, poorly made. Size chart completely wrong. Big disappointment.This resembles nothing that is pictured when it arrives. It is way too big and so cheaply assembled that even if it did fit it would not be flattering.  Don’t buy this.My wife took another reviewers advice and ordered a larger size than normal and they fit well enough. The problem is these underwear are poorly assembled and so flimsy that putting them on will cause them to fall apart.Item came ripped. Did not like it.Quality was nice and looks as picturedI ordered two sizes up and fit fine but the fabric to cover the pooch doesn’t fit at allIt just looks like a bad landing stripMe llego descosido y mal terminado\\xa0Cute. Fit is alright, not snug, but not loose either. Not worth the price though. Color is nice shade of purple. The manufacturing of it could have been better.I ordered one to see if I wanted to order the pack, and the answer is no. I\\'m surprised one size can fit most, and it looked and fit exactly like the picture and as expected. It did seem a bit large going on but fit fine. It\\'s like a scrap of loose cloth and can be confusing to put on. The lace is very thin and just detached from the sides without any tampering. Not the best quality. It wasn\\'t even a one-wear pair and will have to go straight to the trash... Two stars instead of one because it was just like the image and fit.I was kinda nervous about purchasing this. Didn\\'t know if it would be exactly how it\\'s pictured. But I must say I wasn\\'t disappointed at all. It\\'s stretchy and very comfortable!The title on this item says pack of 6. Actual quanity recieved was 1.Ready for panty penetration.Amazingly, this product really does fit any size! It is super comfy and comes in some great colors.I don\\'t really have much to say. Fun, easy access, sexy, comfy.My girlfriends is just a large in panties. Though technically they did fit (they went on), it did not look like a good fit and was too tiny. Might look right on a small woman.I love this!!! It doesn’t squeeze and cause you to look like a busted can of biscuits and the material is so soft. It doesn’t offer much support but since I have implants that doesn’t matter to me. My husband loves the way the straps above the breasts look. It was a complete success!! I highly recommend this brand!!!! I’m 5’9, 135 pounds.Pleasantly surprised! This fit wonderfully and made me feel so sexy. The straps add that little bit of naughty and the bows make it sweet. Perfect combination of naughty and nice. For the money you can\\'t go wrong. I\\'m 5\\'4\" 120 lbs and went with a small. I\\'m a 34 D and the material stretched to fit. Love this!The top is definitely a small, many nip slips. But altogether it’s so hot on.I ordered a large, I am usually between a medium and a large.  I\\'m 5\\'5\", about 155lbs, and I\\'m a 38D.  Fits amazingly well.  really love the strappy bottoms and the cutout in the back.  I can\\'t go jogging in this but it is supportive for what it does :) I\\'m not attaching a photo because....reasons, but trust me, it looks amazing on me!! the bottoms aren\\'t adjustable so I would buy the the size you would for normal underwear; the top is all ties so it\\'s pretty customizable.Great item, comfortable and very sexy.Small really fit like a small! Finally!! (I have major issues finding “smalls” in lingerie on Amazon that actually fits like a small).Top is cute, and is very flattering on petite breasts. It ties so it can be adjusted to fit.Amazingly, the bottoms fit great, and are sexy and cute.I’ve ordered several items from this brand and their smalls are either huge or ill fitting. This piece was my winner! Sexy, flattering, fitted- and I would definitely order again.For reference, I ordered a small, 5’5” 120lbs,30b/32a, waist 27.5”, hip 37.5”. My rib cage measure 27.5”, and I carry my weight on hips/butt.\\xa0Thank you to Amazon for prompt shipping Service! Look at this simple gorgeous sexy 2 piece bra and panty set! Barely covers my rear but the straps with the cute bow on the back really adds a cute touch. Love how the straps over the breasts look. So easy to wear just ties behind the neck in swim suit bikini style. Size small fits my 5\\'2\", 115 lb, 32B cup .I was hesitant to buy it because I feel I’m on the larger squishier side with my body type, but this fits beautifully. I especially love the underwear. I’m not chesty and have a big butt and legs and it fit just fine. I’m a 32B and the bra fit well also. I bought a medium.So happy with this purchase! I got the set of 6.  They were delivered in a cute little gift box. The colors are true to the photos and they seem very well made. The lace in the back is very pretty and intricate! I’m not sure what the material is, it’s not cotton and is a little shiny, so I’m not sure how they’ll wash yet. I’m 5’8 and 150lbs., got the small and they fit perfectly. Recommend!I am 5’8” 205 lbs, curvy, usually wear an 18w.  Size XL fit me nicely.  Very pretty.  Will probably order more.  Recommend!I ordered size large since I usually wear a size 8 in jeans. They were a little more high waisted than I thought they would be but fit comfortably. Since they are lace, I put them in a net bag to wash and hung to dry and they’ve held up well in the laundry. They came in a cute pink box that would have been perfect as a gift box had the scan bar been put on the bottom instead of the top. It doesn’t peel off easily at all. I am very pleased with the colors. The lace is soft and not itchy at all as some can be.Really cute packaging. As a girl with some junk, I always have issues with tighter waistbands and leg holes. I was hoping these would be seamless and as smooth as Lacey pantries can be but they are a little tighter in those areas and makes things looks bulgier than they should. Now I have to lose a few to wear em!I love these panties. They are comfortable and cute/sexy. For reference i am 5’2 175 lbs and curvy. I ordered the xl. I could have got away with a large but i went up a size just to make sure it covered my butt and didn’t give me a wedgie. They are perfect. Highly recommend these.So I was attracted to this panty because of the lace and satin:)....Getting all the colors in the mail solidified my opinion.  Very comfortable....Very Sexy!!!....I\\'m a 34\" waist...Thought an XL was the way to go....A large would have worked, but the XL isn\\'t overly large....They\\'re very comfy, but two of them had loose strings when I took them out of the box. The pink box they came in is really pretty, and the colors of the panties themselves are pretty as well. I wear a size 4 US, and got a small. It fits perfectly.I love these! They came as a box set. The material has a soft and silk like feel and they never ride up! The pattern in the lace (on the back) is beautiful as well! One of the most comfortable pairs of underwear that I own. Definitely ordering another set soon. The colors were true to the images depicted on the product page, they fit better than expected and they arrived on time as well. They definitely keep me feeling sexy but I love that I don\\'t have to compromise my comfort either! Thank you!These are gorgeous! Comfortable and quality. I\\'m a voluptuous size 16 and ordered the xxl, they are a perfect sexy fit!Very sexy and great feeling panties.  My girlfriend loves them on me:)  She especially likes the white ones I got in another order.  They look amazing from behind.  Also, these are very durable.  Most lace panties tear after a short bit.  I wear these under jeans and they\\'re still perfect.  I\\'ve had these for months and will buy more.I didn\\'t think I\\'d like this style, I\\'m a Hanes cotton brief girl, but they are super cute and while they are \"thong like\", quite cheeky, they are not uncomfortable at all.I love the soft, sexy lacey booty, but I don\\'t like how tight the tops are. These panties fit my booty, but they squeeze a bit into my hip fat. I have large, fatty hips and not much in the trunk, so it was kind of expected. I have yet to find panties to fit my figure perfectly. I usually wear between a large size 7 and an XL 8 in panties, depending on the fit. Still like them and will probably buy more when I need panties again.These are Asian size panties so be sure to order them in a larger size.These s panties are really pretty and I love the colors. But they are a little tight on me. I weigh 140 lbs and ordered a Large.Ordered an 2XL because I like my panties to be comfortable and thought since not made in US they would run smaller. Tag on panties I received show that they are an XXXL. I was disappointed because they were so pretty, soft and colors vibrant.  Knew I couldn’t return them worn but I tried a pair on and they fit perfectly and comfortable. Happy with purchase. Haven’t washed them yet but they appeared well constructed.They’re cute and fit true to size when initially tried on. After one wash (and NO dryer)  the entire lace bottom panel shrunk so that it covered a narrow strip down the middle of the bottom. The rest seems fine and size stayed same. Just don’t love that they almost turned into a thong.So I will start off by saying I am very picky about my underwear - it must be (mostly) cotton, super comfortable and not give me any sort of muffin top whatsoever.  These guys hit all of my underwear requirements right on the head!  I have been searching for the perfect thongs for a while now and I feel like my search is over with these.  I was wearing the cotton thongs with lace waist prior and although they are great at not marking under clothes, the lace falls apart way too fast in the wash and I don\\'t find them to be nearly as comfortable as these.  I will also mention that I have only washed these once so far so I cannot comment on the longevity just yet but I think they\\'ll hold up way better than the lace ones.A few things:1. Two were repeats.  I don\\'t care about this and neither does the hubs.2. They do have tags on the back and I wish they didn\\'t.  The tags have to be cut off as opposed to being able to remove them completely by un-sewing them.  This is the only negative for me.3. Some are softer than others but they\\'re all still very comfortable.4. The cotton crotch lining piece is bigger than in any of my other thongs which I really like.  It comes up higher in the front.5. They are snug and stay perfectly in place without creating any tightness in the waist.  I practically don\\'t even feel them.6. They come in patterns which makes them cuter than the all plain colored ones usually available in cotton.I hope this review helps someone else since I know how difficult it can be to find perfect underwear.  I love these so much I am about to order my second pack because I\\'m worried they\\'ll either stop selling them or they\\'ll alter how they\\'re made somehow.Update 8/9/18 - attaching a picture of packs two and three I just received.  They came in the exact same patterns as the first pack and the two repeats are also the same (plain beige and purple pattern).  I will note the price went up a bit - I paid $19.86 for the first pack and $21.17 for the other two packs.  I love these so much I don\\'t want to wear any of my other underwear anymore.  Also, I have now washed and dried the first pack a few times and they still look brand new.In stores, I usually buy a size 6, which is a Medium/Large... My hips measure around 39\", so I ordered the Large just to be safe, and they fit very well:  no muffin top at all, but not too baggy.  They are really good quality for the price... I have bought other cheap packs of thongs on Amazon which fall apart quickly.  But these look very well stitched, and the cotton is not too thin.  I received a few duplicate patterns, but that doesn\\'t bother me, since I still have about 9 different patterns to choose from out of 12.  Can\\'t complain.Update:  after several months of wearing and washing, these thongs have proven themselves extremely comfortable and durable.  They wash very well and hold up well:  No color fading, stitching failure, or fuzz bumps.  I\\'m now buying a second pack and replacing ALL of my inferior underwear with these thongs.  Very glad I found these!These fit well and are nice quality especially for the price... However, the description states that there would be no duplicates and that they are tagless for comfort with the size printed on the back waistband. I received at least two sets of duplicate colors/prints, and each and every pair had a tag in the back waistband that I had to cut out as it would have been very scratchy. For the price however they can\\'t be beat- they\\'re not the cute prints shown in the photo description either, but they\\'re not terrible ugly either! They do fit great and they are very soft and definitely well made for the price.Thongs are such a tricky thing for me. Most of them are so poorly made, it\\'s frustrating to find anything.I\\'m 5\\'6 and 127lbs and the small fit me perfectly. I could probably be a few pounds heavier and they\\'d still fit and a few pounds smaller and they\\'d fit even then.1) perfect fit (use the size chart and measure yourself... going by typical sizes probably won\\'t help you)2) adorable cute patterns3) not too juvenile4) so comfortable5) cotton cotton cotton6) feel high quality7) price is phenomenal!!Can I say enough good things? Buy these and see for yourself :)Very cute, the reviews about duplicates is definitely accurate. I don’t care about the duplicates but I’m sad I didn’t get the Poka dot ones, that’s the pair I wanted the most!Highly annoyed that you almost cannot find a thong in a store anymore. Seems like when I do find them, they\\'re all really short. Like, they sit half way up your butt cheeks instead of your waist. These are great! I don\\'t have that problem with these.This is a great bundle pack of underwear! They\\'re not for a sexy date night but at the same time they\\'re cute enough that I would have no problems with a date seeing me in these. They\\'re really comfortable but I wouldn\\'t say they are completely no show as the cotton band that goes around your hips is wide and tends to roll up when you sit down (or at least on me). Maybe if I went a size down this wouldn\\'t happen as it\\'d be a little tighter around the hip but again not really an issue under most clothes.Yes you get duplicates in the pack but I\\'m pretty sure these are just in a huge bin and 12 are counted out at random. Again, to me, this is really no big deal. I mean come on you\\'re wearing them under your clothes and for the money I don\\'t really think anyone has room to complain about this.These also hold up very well when run through the washer AND dryer!! I usually air dry thongs but, living in a studio, my place started to look absolutely insane on laundry day with clothes drying everywhere. So lazy me just tosses these in the dryer and if there is any shrinkage its very minimal. I\\'ve only had 1 pair tear at the side seams but that was actually due to the washing machine and me rushing while pulling the clothes out.I\\'ve purchased this pack twice now and as long as the price stays similar, I will continue to when needed.I read others reviews stating these run a bit small. I wear a medium in Victoria\\'s Secret, so I ordered these in a large and they fit perfectly. The material is very soft and comfortable, the lace is elegant and sexy, the husband is happy. I would definitely recommend to a friend!I have not washed or worn these yet, but so far I am pleased. They are very pretty; I love the colors. The material is very soft. The price is much better than what I would pay Target or someplace similar. I am 5\\'4\" 120 lbs, and I got a medium to ensure that they did not dig at all. They fit exactly like I was hoping, just skimming my skin. Size small probably could have fit me, but it possibly could have cut into my sides, creating bulges under clothes, so I went with the medium instead. These are more of a low-rise fit instead of coming high up over the hip bone like some do. All in all, I\\'m happy!AMAZING! In love and I will most likely purchase again. I am usually a small, but after reading the reviews I got a size up and they fit perfectly. They are super cute and comfy.The bows fell off while only wearing them once, and the tags completely disentegrated after one wash. The company said I must have received a bad batch and said they would refund me, but haven’t gotten a refund yet...These thongs are so soft and comfortable it feels like you\\'re not wearing any underwear!  Very sexy!  I just hope they stand up to the wash!  They run a bit small, so I bought L as I usually buy M.  The Ls are a great fit!  On the face of it, they look a bit flimsy, so I hope they stand up to washing!These are incredibly soft! They looked tiny but actually fit perfectly! They don’t ride, they’re extremely comfortable and a great priceThey run just a little bit small.  I usually wear a small, so I ordered a medium - and even after washing/drying, they\\'re a little snug.  Not unwearable, but somewhat uncomfortable after a full day of wear.I love these underpants. Very comfy and cute. I like my underwear a little looser so I got a medium, but they have good stretch so I would recommend staying true to size. (I’m 5’4 ~125lbs. Usually wear S/M)I like that it fits to size and is very comfortable.Worth the money and items has a lot of underwear in the pack. You cant go wrong with this. They stretch and had good sturdy fabric and well made. They look like they will last a while.Online showed size 7 which is a large but I received a medium so I returned as soon as I saw size.I ordered these in a size 10, they fit like a 7 or smaller. They also don\\'t stretch much. I\\'m a size 18 in pants. Disappointed because they are a lot  of undies for the price.. the size 10 would fit if you wear a 12 pants.Buena calidad. Suaves y talla ideal. Se las regalé a mi novia con cadera 113 cm. Y le quedaron un poco justas nada grave. Son talla L.Better than VS! Very cute and comfy and you get so many for the priceGood quality and fit just right, thanks!I ordered a large and received a medium.I debated between the cotton and poly seamless ones and everyone raves about the cotton and says the seamless ones are terrible. The cotton don’t run big like the reviewers said and they don’t shrink or hug nicely even after washing. I wish I trusted my gut and got the seamless non cotton pack instead.First of all I wear size 5 or small in women panties. There is no stretch to material as described. It\\'s shame that I will not be able to wear them. I love the colors and softness of material. I don\\'t like that there is a tag on the sides (not comfortable). The waist band has thick seams all the way around. Seams can be seen through tight leggings.Good fit and very soft. No elastic at all so they are just like tshirts. Once you wear them for a bit, they fall down. One of the benefits of thong panties is that you dont have to mess with them. You have to pull these up a dozen times a day.Although they\\'re not completely cotton, they\\'re very soft on your skin. They make it feel like you\\'re not wearing any underwear but also provide the support you need when you\\'re wearing them.The best underwear I’ve ever purchased! So comfortable...great material...invisible under clothes. I’m ordering more!Undoubtedly the softest thongs. Perfect placement to cover abdomino plasty incision line. Very comfortable. Maybe size up, though.These are just perfect- soft, comfy, cut to the right shape. Very pleased!Soft material and doesn\\'t ride up so I lived themThe photo included for the item is exactly what the panties look like upon receiving them in the mail. I weigh about 117, and wear a medium in every other brand panties I’ve ever bought so I chose a medium size. When I took them out the package they looked big, trying them on they fit good maybe a lil smaller would have been perfect, but once washed and dried I guarantee it will fit perfect. The price for this item exceeds the quality I was expecting. Love these Dream Girl panties and can’t wait to order different pairs.I love these panties! Very sexy and comfortable. I like the fit and the softness of the material. I bought two pair, this one in slate and another in black. I especially like this slate color which is more of a grey than blue... but a really nice elegant shade, I may have to see if it is still available in torquoise and buy that one too.It was great! I love the style, cheeky but not a thong. And the front is very sexy. It’s delicate but not fragile. A bit stretchy so you could go a bit smaller. I got medium and it fits good but could be tighter. I’m a 36.5 inch hips and am a petite(short) girl at 5’3”.What can I say. These are what my 80 yr old mother wanted for her birthday.Bought a large — I weigh 115, 5’2 ... to me, runs big as I am a small in regular underwear (briefs). Front string is too long and gives the underwear this awkward lookPerfect fit and super nice fabric. I love the look, and so did the lucky person to see me in them. Great purchase, would definitely recommend. For sure my new favorite pair of pantiesThe product was very pretty and fit well enough, a little loose (I ordered a medium) but wearable. What bothered me the most is that in the crotch area a rough seam piles the crotch and is very uncomfortable. Others might be better, but my pair wasn’t that comfortable and was very annoying.To hard to get on and take offThis is way to small for a large I got cant even put on. Sorry but not happy with the item at all.The panties are not how they are pictured dont waist ur time nor money on this product from this seller.A little on the small sideNot even the same lace. Was cheaply made. Amazon should NOT allow China to sell on here.😔 muy pequeños..Cheap and poor quality don\\'t buy.Amazon, don\\'t change this product.  Don\\'t add more polyester.  Don\\'t mess around trying to save money by making the product cheaper. Just charge more if you have to.  I once wore a brand of Hanes as my comfort underwear,  they were like butter. But Hanes changed the recipe and the replacement was like margarine.  4 years.  I looked for 4 years.  I wasted so much money looking for underwear.  Now, here it is.  A great pair of underwear that is not $15 a pair.Thank you Amazon.I have yet to wear the underwear. I’m not sensitive to wearing non cotton panties. I just prefer cotton for the air wicking/ breathable  benefits for my lady parts haha. since I work long hr shifts and workout. I chose amazon basics bc I wanted black panties, cotton, bikini, and affordable. I ordered XL. I wear size XL in Victoria secret sizing but I can also fit a L. Typically I wear size L for leggings.I wanted the underwear  to fit comfortable and I knew I’d wash and dry them. Which I did as soon as they arrived and no snagging happened. They looked and felt the same as when they arrived.I’m a size 14/16 in jeansI’m about 48” around my booty and 44” around my belly pooch aka the lower belly pouch that is hard to freaking loose hahaha. Around my actual waist which around my naval is  41”Hope these measurements help!Thank you, Amazon.  It only took about 8 years, but I\\'m now back to feeling bliss again in my cotton undies.  I guess I can officially throw away the 10-year old V. Secret undies I\\'ve been hoarding since they changed their style to one that only 6-year old girls can wear.  My husband thanks you for that.  These undies are incredibly comfy and WILL NOT RIDE UP.  I am 44 and wear a size 6/8 with a real booty, and the medium fits great.  The elastic doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s even there, but believe me it works. Yes, they show a panty line.  If anyone tells you they don\\'t, then they are either lying or are wearing very baggy pants.  I don\\'t wear them under tight pants - thats what thongs are for.  I do, however, put them on immediately after coming home from work and when I\\'m wearing looser clothing.  They\\'re also a dream to sleep in.  They get softer as you wash them.  I\\'ve bought every package of these that Amazon offers and was tickled pink to see they finally added a pack of only black.  My only negative is the look (which luckily just doesn\\'t matter so much to me since I\\'m not an underwear model.)  To me, they are a cross between bikinis and lower briefs.  The band on the side is much wider than typical bikinis, but I\\'m guessing that might be why the fit across the butt is perfect.  My pictures are of one pair of washed undies so you see what they look like in real life.  So, Amazon....please don\\'t go changing things.  Don\\'t put spandex in and cut the back so they look like bad thongs that real women can\\'t wear.  Please keep them just the way they are and make a million more colors.  I will continue to buy them and hoard them like the 80s.  Bye Bye, Vic\\'s Secret.  I\\'m too old for you.These are garbage. It’s too bad because they are comfortable, fit good, and a good price. I washed the whole pack prior to wearing and they started falling apart in that first wash. Each wash they unravel more and more. Very disappointing.Several months ago, I purchased some new cotton bikini underwear and prefer them over other, more revealing styles. I\\'m a mom and I\\'ve discovered I prefer comfort over style so cotton bikinis suit me really well! I saw these underwear and I\\'ll admit, I was a bit skeptical because I wondered if they would be good quality or not. I have some items from the Amazon Basics line and like them so I figured I\\'d give these a try.The Amazon Essentials Cotton Bikini underwear come in a six-pack and you can currently choose from two styles: basic assorted and fashion assorted. The basic assorted package comes with the following colors: two white, one light pink, one light purple, one black, and one black and white stripe. The fashion assorted package contains: one salmon color, one navy, one navy and white stripe, one light purple, one white with black polka dots, and one white with black flowers. These underwear are made of 95% cotton and 5% elastane. You can machine wash in warm water and tumble dry low. These are made in Sri Lanka.I initially ordered the basic assorted package and liked them enough that I immediately ordered the fashion assorted package as well. The underwear are very soft and comfortable! I really like the variety of colors and I would buy more if they decided to provide more colors. I\\'ve washed these underwear several times now according to the instructions and I didn\\'t notice any shrinking. The stitching looks like good quality and I love that they don\\'t ride up, which means these will work nicely when I exercise! I usually wear yoga pants and notice slight panty lines but they are hardly noticeable if you aren\\'t looking for them. The bikini style sits comfortably at my hip and the band at the waist measures 2 3/8 inches. For size reference, I am 5\\'6\", 165 pounds with a bit of a belly after having my twins and I purchased the large size which fit perfectly. I generally wear a 10 or 12 in pants and am glad I purchased the large.I am happy I found these because they are incredibly comfortable. When I wear them, I actually hardly notice I\\'m wearing them because they are so light and comfortable! If Amazon decided to make more of these in different colors, I will definitely buy those as well. If you are looking for a good-quality, inexpensive and comfortable option to very expensive underwear, these are it! If these don\\'t last as long as I\\'d like, I will update this review. Until then, I recommend these underwear because they are some of the most comfortable underwear I\\'ve owned and they don\\'t cost an arm and a leg!This is a really sexy panty. I normally wear a medium, and these fit really well, but run a bit smaller than other Velvet Kitten products...but not so small as to buy a larger size. The pink on the zebra/pink color is a very bright pink.The craftsmanship and quality are excellent. These are very comfortable.The lace on the back stretches a bit, so they are nicely form fitting and flattering.I like these so much I bought another pair, and would recommend these to anyone.The fabric and stitching was  not as comfortable as soft thought it would be..and very Little stretch.  Pretty color / zebra print is nice, but rather small for a size nedium. Good for any guy who wants to spice up their underwear drawer.I usually wear a large panty, and after the reviews on sizing, I ordered an XL and they were still too small for comfort. If they made an XXL they may have been ok. I wear a 10/12 dress and 12 pants. FYI They are pretty though.I found these to be a bit small in the back. They needed to be about another 2-3 inches wider.I received this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased review. This has not influenced my opinions on the product. I have written honestly about my feelings and experiences with the product. I have no connection with the company and I have not been compensated for this review other than the product.These are really pretty and look just as described, but I\\'d ordered two sizes up. I ordered one size up and they are a little too tight. They don\\'t have a lot of stretch either because of the lace. The color is a little brighter in person. Other than the sizing issue, they are great!Comfortable for short term wear for like a special evening. These are more underwear I would wear all day. The sizing is accurate and they are comfortable.Wrong setLooked like it would be a bit small at first but actually fits pretty nice and is comfortable. Looks great.Helps build muscle strength after childbirth and I no longer fear sneezing or laughing too hard. (Thanks kids. You\\'re the best!!) This product quickly made all my skepticism vanish. I\\'m tempted exercise with it at work. As stated in the instructions, the bluetooth needs to be kept uncovered. If you need to walk around during exercises, keep the clothing covering light or the bluetooth will disconnect at the worst time possible. While the product is discreet and mostly quiet, I\\'m assuming you will draw attention to yourself if used in public. The higher settings are not as quiet. Plus I\\'ve found it easier to say \"I don\\'t know\" because it\\'s hard to explain to your kids where that weird noise is coming from. And for the love of humanity.....DON\\'T hug people while in use unless you want an awkward conversation. It makes your body vibrate. Almost forgot to mention.....this is a really great product!!!!!! HAPPY KEGELS!!!!This makes kegel exercises WAY more fun. Definitely thousand times better than normal Kegel weights. At first I thought the games were a bit childish but now I find them cute and kind of addicting. I love the weight lifting game! The pelvic floor assesment is pretty cool to check your improvement. You can also control the device with your phone and play around with the ¨massage¨ function. That\\'s definately my husband’s favorite part ;) I am starting to think that\\'s actually why he bought it for me lol.I’ve bought every kind of Kegel device you can buy, the yoni egg, the weights, you name it. This is the best one you can buy. I’ve been doing kegels wrong up till now. Dont spend your money on anything else, trust me.I have been using this Kegel exerciser for almost a week. Over the years, I tried a couple of other Kegel products and gave up. I think I needed more of a “beginner” option, and this has that. It is the first one I can see myself using consistently and making improvements with. I prefer the assessment mode and the self-programmed mode (manual training in the app) as well the mode without the app. I have weak muscles and those modes have more feedback that allows me to see what/how I am doing. I was able to use this right away, but I knew I wasn’t quite using it optimally in a couple of ways. The in-app information and email support were incredibly helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure I had more than enough information to start to succeed. As a result of their help and this innovative product, I already am seeing improvements. :) (small steps, but progress)Prior to writing this review, I wrote support to ask about a couple of less expensive, similar looking products I saw on Amazon. They proudly explained the differences, which include the others not offering their top-notch, medical profession support but also  materials quality and hygienic design aspects that aren’t obvious in the photos. As a result, I feel even more confident recommending this particular item.I love it! I use it with my husband as for play it\\'s fun no one knows but us yes it\\'s been used in public 😉I bought this to help strengthen my pelvic floor muscles to prevent constant misalignment of my sacrum that was accompanied by low back and SI Joint pain.  It has helped me to be consistent with my exercises; whereas, I previously would do them when I would remember and they were often half-hearted.  The app helps to gives a visual gauge of the contraction; I didn\\'t realize how weak my pelvic floor muscles were!  Although I have more work to do, within a week, my sacrum is remaining more stable and my back pain has subsided. I am definitely going to keep at it.  I have contacted the company regarding questions and they are very responsive.  Things I think would be helpful:  a better diagram to help know that the device is in proper place and to know what the healthy numbers are for pelvic floor strength and contraction time.Apparently I got a defective model. If you have any issues, contact Joyon directly for help rather than going through amazon. I’m going to leave the photos up to compare in case you are unsure if you got a defective one. The defective models have a charging port on the body, as shown.I was recommended to try this by my pelvic health physical therapist. According to her this is much better than just doing kegels and the weighted balls because of the biofeedback capabilities. There are other smart devices available but this one does the same as others without breaking the bank. Now I can see in real time if I am using my muscles correctly. I can already feel my pelvic muscles stronger, which is a great help with my prolapse. Thank you!I was disappointed in the change to the crotch area of these panties.  They used to have the standard rectangle of cotton in the crotch but changed to a small diamond shaped patch that doesn\\'t cover the area.  The result was that the lace rubbed over your private area when you moved and caused irritation.Today I received a replacement order with the appropriate cotton rectangle in the crotch area!  I am pleased and amazed that this company would take such good care of a customer!  The new panties are wonderful and I am more than pleased!These were a heavier lace than I was expecting, but they are so soft and comfortable. The only thing I didn\\'t like at first is the little \\'gem\\' at the front, but I have come to appreciate it in helping me determine front/back lol! It doesn\\'t irritate at all and even looks kind of cute. I ordered the Size 9 and wear a size 18 pants - these fit perfectly.Terrible fit for me, I’m a bigger lady bought the size 9 as I wear a size 14 dress and these things don’t fit anywhere. Ride up your crotch, don’t even cover your crack in back. The hot pink color is beautiful as well as the material is soft and the little rhinestone detail is pretty. But definitely not practical panties, and I’d be hard pressed to even wear these for a few hours for a special occasion. So, for me, until I drop about 20 pounds and tone my tush and belly, these will be sitting in the drawer.I love these Smart and Sexy products! It’s difficult to find sexy feminine bras in my size ,34D, with matching panties. I couldn’t be more thrilled! I haven’t wore them yet so I can’t speak to comfort or durability but they are gorgeous and I can’t believe the price for the quality. The bra fits true to size. I don’t like tight panties that give me muffin top so I always buy larger.  I got a 7 but could have ordered the 6 in these. There is no pinch or panty line because there is no waistband and  I like the cute “cheeky “ effect on the rear of these panties. For reference, I’m 5’3, 135 pounds and curvy.They fit perfectly and are so comfortable!  And pretty - I have the bras to match (they are awesome too). So nice to find things my size that aren’t ugly lol. We heavy people deserve cute things too😃 I’m buying more and tossing my old ones out. YaySo I ordered one size smaller than my normal size (cause usually online is bigger) and they looked horrible on me!!  Looked like two sizes to big! Awful fit!  Not to mention I paid the shipping to get the item.  In order to return it I have to pay $6 shipping, just to get a $10 refund.  I don’t think so. That’s stupid to pay the return shipping, After paying the initial shipping, just to get $4.  So annoying.  Guess that’s how this seller keeps people from returning products.  I also purchased some of their bras and they all fit to small.  Completely disappointed. WILL never buy again.They look great!  I used to buy them years ago at Walmart.  However, as pretty as they are, they seem to have very little elasticity in the waist as compared to the original design.  They slip around the hips too much.  Let\\'s put it this way.  I feel better wearing them with pants than dresses for the obvious reason I just stated.The shape is off... I’m 5’8 and 200lbs I have hips and hear didn’t fit right. I’ll wear them but not long ;-/ they have nice material just the “V” shape to them seems little over the top and not quite what the picture showed. Again the material is nice for being less money. But if you are a woman with some shape. Might want to rethink buying them.Super cute and comfortable G strings. Lovely colors and well stitched. Fits perfectly on a 5\\'4, 165lbs curvy woman.These are pretty high waisted, other than that amazing. They look super cute, are not itchy, and are well made. They are also american sized.These are cute and fit well! Quality seems good so far, I\\'m happy with these. They appear to be true to size, I usually and somewhere between a medium and small and I got a medium, they fit perfect.Was happy at first with these, however after only one wear and one wash one of them is coming apart.Cute and they fit great for the price.  I was afraid they would be to flimsy or small, but they are fine.  I have approximately 41\" hips and I got the XL.They’re decent quality for the price. They’re just kinda high cut.Comfy and cute. Only problem I see with this is that the extra cloth on the very bottom was sown on in a way that it bumps out a bit and sorta looks like you\\'re wearing a panty liner. Ahhh.But besides that they fit great! I usually wear either a small or med. Since small panties sometimes dig a little too much, I got these in a small and they\\'re perfect.These are way too small and very cheap. Small strings keep coming off of them and they feel like they\\'re going to come apart any second. All of them just went in the trash after the first week.It was amazing fit and super sexyFun and flatteringSo happy I stumbled across this bra. The fit is amazing, it is incredibly comfortable and it didn\\'t break the bank.  I\\'ve purchased several bras from a well known store for 4 times the amount of this one, and it blows them out of the water!  This may be the best fitting bra I\\'ve ever owned!  Will definitely buy more!When I say I am crying HAPPY TEARS y’all! 😭 I have had big breast my whole life and I’ve NEVER been able to wear sexy bras. I wear a 46DDD and for whatever reason it is IMPOSSIBLE to find a bra (let alone a sexy one) in my size. It’s like my size was always skipped over. And if I happened to find one, let’s face it, it was an ugly beige color that made my breasts pointy looking, they pinched, I felt suffocated, uncomfortable and my breasts would overflow out the top! It was highly unflattering. UNTIL I FOUND THIS BRA!! Ladies, my big breasted sisters, THIS BRA IS AMAZING. I’m not lying when I cried happy tears as soon as I put it on. It fits PERFECTLY. There’s no stabbing pain from the underwire, my shoulders aren’t being gouged into from the straps, my WHOLE breasts fits perfectly inside the cups of the bra, there’s no overflow out the top even when I’m laying down on my side, it gives my breast the natural look (NOT POINTY!) it’s BEAUTIFUL and so SEXY! And I feel sexy wearing it! It seriously just gave me confidence to post this picture. THATS how good it is! That’s how bad I want to show you other girls this amazing bra! I am definitely buying all 16 colors! THANK YOU FOR MAKING A SEXY BRA FOR THE BIG BREASTED GIRLS!!If I could find a way to give this one and only best reviews I would. This company woman is run by women and they know how to make bras. I have been searching for the right bra forever. I got my size correct did the math and not even the most expensive bras fit right. The girls were either falling out or it looked like I had one boob. Then not to mention the stretch and lack of comfort. You try these yourself and return them but I doubt if you will return them for the dollar amount and the comfort these are the BEST BRAS I have ever worn. If you don\\'t mind underwire they fit with perfection and as a woman in her years and hard to find the right fit these are the ones for me. I\\'m a 36 C now that\\'s a common size but do you think I could find one that fits? No way! Don\\'t get it. Are men making some bras cause as far as I know that is what I have to think cause unless you spend a huge amount on a bra or not they don\\'t fit? Thank you, women,, who own this business. I went back online and ordered 5 more.For reference, I wear a 38d-40c from VS depending on whether the cups are padded. I bought this in a 40c. The cups fit perfectly- they have some nice stretch to them. The band is a little snug, but I think it will loosen a bit. The bra is a soft lace and was inexpensive (I pd $8). The color is bright and pretty(I got pink). The bra provides a little lift without being tight. Cups are full and straps are thick. I think this will make a nice Saturday afternoon bra, but I doubt it will last longer than two-three months. For the money, it\\'s nice. Pretty, light weight, soft, and stretchy. I might order a few more after I wear it a couple of times to test it out....and I’m actually happy with it! The sizing is accurate. I’m wearing a 32D. It’s comfortable and full coverage, no falling out when you bend over, no readjusting. They stay snugly and comfortably in place.It fits true to size but there is too much give and boob separation. The wire digs into my underarm. Not enough support on the side of my boobs. Too much boob separation is the main deal breaker but I\\'d buy more bc they\\'re cheap and not at all horrible. Chick with smaller breasts would likely have no issue with this bra.BUT...It\\'s overall comfortable, the material isn\\'t bothersome and it\\'s quite soft, not bad for a $10 bra, it\\'s sexy, does not give me torpedo boobs, the back and side straps are kinda wide so there is some back smoothing and only two hooks which is good because I hate the 3-4 hook bras.The first comfortable underwire in my 55 years of trying (I usually end up cutting out the wires).Pretty lace, natural round & feminine shape in the DD cups.The center clings to my chest, so no more mono-boobs!!I have 3 of these, and just ordered 2 more in beige.Previous reviewers warned they may not stand up to machine wash & dry, so I handle gently and all is well after 2 month of exclusive wear.The fabric softens with a few washings  I have tossed all my expensive, uncomfortable bras!!.I cannot recommend this purchase more highly.Unfortunately I always wash garments before I wear them or even try them for any length of time.  This does not allow me to return garments in general. If I had tried this on when I received it I would have send it back. The bra fits when you first put it on but then stretches as the day progresses, it offers little support, and the underwires dig in at the sides as the garment stretches. It will be donated because I cannot wear it for more than a couple hours.Glad to discover this came with a matching thong! Also the adjustable straps mean I can go for a plunging cleavage look or tighten up so the hemline is super high and sexy from the back! Definitely worth the price!Really sexy, elegant lingerie. The quality is awesome. 95% chinion, 5% cotton. It is very soft, smooth and comfortable. Not a see through chemise. It has adjustable shoulder straps which help to have a better control of your bust. The cut is very simple but sexy and flattering.. I\\'m an XL in shirts so I order an xxl! It was perfect and I couldn\\'t be more pleased!The material is very soft. Feels great on. The straps are adjustable too. I’m extremely happy with this purchase!My wife looked so stunning in this, that I couldn\\'t take my eyes off of her, and then I couldn\\'t keep my hands off of her, and then....let\\'s just say I couldn\\'t wait for this to come off either.  It was some of the best I\\'ve ever had.  Even though it covers the midriff, I find myself insisting on her wearing this most times we \"get together.\"Edited to add:  I bought the Medium (she\\'s between a Small and a Medium) and it fit just a bit snug.  If you prefer a little more room, order one size up from what you usually wear.  If you have a large bust (she\\'s a 34C, so we were ok with the M) order two sizes up.  It doesn\\'t have a lot of room in the chest area.Super cute! Great buy, I will definitely be purchasing in other colors. I am 5\\'3 and 125 lbs, small bust and larger butt - Small fit perfectly.  Love the adjustable straps. I didn\\'t use the included g string.great material. I am 170 5\\'2 38 DD and the large fit greatFits as listed for size. The G string runs runs big. I really bought the top for my wife. The G string went on my rear view mirror.I have a very small bust with a large bottom and this makes my body look amazing! It covers up the top enough to make me feel comfortable and shows just a little bit of my behind which amplifies my better quality. I bought a size small and I weigh 130 pounds 5’5” bra size 32 A, 38” around my bottom. My husband says it’s his favorite.These could have been so perfect, but unfortunately the main feature was poorly sewn. You can see in the picture how the heart cutout is totally lopsided, which kind of defeats the purpose of getting these over another lacy boy short. I’m only giving 2 stars instead of one because otherwise they do fit and the fabric is nice, but I’m so bummed (pun intended) because I’m not sure I will dare use them. My hubby will probably point out that they are wonky looking, which takes away from the whole sexy idea! Seriously, they should not have sold something with such shoddy work.These are incredibly cute and seem to be very well made (especially when compared to the other panties I ordered at the same time!).  They fit a tad small but given the style and cloth I expected that and adjusted the size accordingly.  They made it through the wash just fine and I\\'m looking forward to being able to wear them regularly.My wife loves the open back heart design and the purple lace flowers are so gorgeous. Fit perfectly and is more comfortable than most lace panties. It\\'s hard to find something both sexy and comfortable at the same time.These panties are a cute idea, but not so cute on me... I have a rather small bum, so my bum fit entirely through the holes, which created a decidedly unsexy pinching/squeezing effect rather than a peek-a-boo heart over my derriere.Really cute! Probably not going to look like an actual heart unless your butt is perfectly shaped but sexy none the less. Comfortable and fit me as expected.I went a size up, since women\\'s underwear always runs small and I\\'m glad I did. Super cute design, surprisingly well made. Heart doesn\\'t look exactly like a heart but close enough. There is as strap that runs through the heart vertically, if that matters to you.Nice material, great price. My hips are 38 inches, I ordered the medium and they fit fine. I would purchase other items in the future.Soft, with a satin touch. Even after several hand washings it kept it\\'s shape and feel. Very comfortable to wear and extremely cute on. I am ordering all the colors now. Very delighted with this product. Compared to top of line lingerie, it actually was better quality and feel.Quality is top notch, you couldn\\'t find something sexier at Victoria Secret! After reading reviews I was worried that my normal size might be too tight, I ordered it anyway and I\\'m glad I did. It fit perfectly! I\\'m 5\\'6 134lbs, not a curvy shape at all, and I generally wear a size 6 dress. The M fit me perfectly. Hope that helps anyone trying to figure out the size!I LOVE these panties! The only downfall is that they don\\'t have them in more colors. They have the adorable bow that sits right in the center of your hips and above the lacing that criss crosses , allowing for a sneak peek. You get the illusion of wearing a much skimpier style of panties without the discomfort. The material is soft and feels nice against the skin. The cut of the panties and the elasticated lace lays smoothly around the thighs and across the waist.  I think these might have just jumped into top spot in both alluring and comfortable. Please Sofishie make this style and cyt in every color of the rainbow! I\\'d buy every single pair. I wear a size 12 in pants and usually a Lg in panties but whenever there\\'s lace involved I order 1 size up and these are perfect :)I was really unsure of this purchase, assuming it may be either terrible quality or wouldn\\'t fit the way it looks but, to my surprise, it is perfect! The fabric is SO comfortable and the back straps are pretty much unnoticeable. I thought I would only want to wear this for lingerie purposes, but no! I could wear this on a daily basis and be perfectly comfortable. It looks gorgeous too!Bought these for g/f with back opening; she loves the fact she can leave panties on and give me access when we are playing in public. ;)I wanted something to feel sexy on me after just having our fourth baby. I ordered these in a Large (I have my postpartum weight to lose) and they are very flattering and they do not have that infamous crappy tight elastic around your waist/hips. My husband likes them a lot too! Not uncomfortable!I am a size small, but usually have to order a medium to accommodate some cheekiness. I will say that I probably should have ordered a small in these - may fit slightly large. But, they are high quality, very comfortable, and did not come with any snags or tears. Very comfy and sexy!I love these, they make me feel sexy even if the only one who knows they are there is me. Sometimes just feeling good and confident can work wonders. And these are surprisingly comfortable.Nice!! They are very pretty and comfortable! I ordered 2 other styles, one of which I didn\\'t like. I was able to return the other one with a prepaid label and got a quick refund. Then ordered another pair of these in another color! Will definitely keep my eyes out for more Sofishie panties! Great service.Very sexyGirlfriend loves it!Fits great and looks very sexy on. The color is pretty in person. I may have to order it in a few more colors.Completely loved the feel (soft) and fit! Fits true to size. Lingerie is as pictured when arrived. Not too flimsy!  I would definitely order this again in another color.I really love how this set compliments my figure & sits in just the right places. The bottom provides that full support while maintaining the sexy appeal.I love this babydoll! I was worried about the color, but when I opened the package the blue was stunning. This is true to size. I ordered a small and this fit me perfectly. (5\\' 110 lbs, by the way).This is neither too tight nor too lose, and the lace is soft, not scratchy. It\\'s very comfortable. I\\'ve even slept in it a few times. A wonderful, worthwhile purchase, and one I am always excited to wear.5\\'5\" 130lb normally a US size xs or small. Body type is smaller built up top and larger bottom. The size small fit perfectly and looks greatFits very well and I’m a 36DD. I didn’t expect it to fit the way it does so I’m happy with it. It’s obviously a cheaper lingerie piece but I like it and my boyfriend loved it. Perfect for a birthday night on or to pack on vacation!!!Great lingerie set with garter belt. Items came, and met my expectations. Definitely nice material that wasn’t itchy or scratchy. Fits great on me. I wore it a lot. I\\'m planning to get another.I LOVE the bottoms but I underestimated the amount of fabric for the bra and it’s an eye patch on my boobs! It’s my fault, so I’ll be keeping it because the underwear look fantastic and feel very comfortable.I am 5ft 1inch and weigh 105lbs and the size small fit perfectly. I got a great mix of colors with only two pair being the same. They feel and look awesome.Not very satisfied. Was sent three of the same exact sets of colors...totaling 12 pairs. But at least they were pretty colors. So I got three of each color. I did get white, which I\\'m not in love with. Then upon opening I noticed the brand was a totally different brand than advertised. Also four pairs had rips or holes in the lace. I needed undies and figured it was still a good deal so I washed them to wear. Upon trying on after washing, I noticed that although they are all size medium, they fit differently. These could have been REALLY cute, had they been correct sizes and not ripped. So now that I\\'ve already washed them, I\\'m stuck with them and pretty disappointed. I was planning on ordering more, but now I don\\'t think so. Some fit, some creep up. Some had holes, some were good. Not too happy with this purchase.The fit is true to size, I range between a size 8-10 in pants and bought a L, they\\'re super soft and comfy and don\\'t make you look like an overzealous muffin. These might be the only underwear I\\'ve had that don\\'t shimmy up my derriere all the time, and if they do end up in the grand canyon I don\\'t have to worry about my underwear sending smoke signals from all the friction.Great price for the quantity and quality.Bonus is that they don\\'t give you longbottom syndrome which most cotton panties tend to do, they also don\\'t shrink when just tossed into the washer and dryer (I know, bad panty etiquette... I don\\'t have the time to do a delicates load, I barely have time to fold my laundry- I have a clean laundry basket and a questionable laundry basket).I am a personal trainer who loves her squats and booty workouts, I should have ordered a Large instead of Medium. These fit my hips nicely but my cheeks pop out more than I would like; my husband disagrees though and loves them, ha! So for the ladies with larger assets you may want to order up a size, otherwise these are comfy, cute, and soft! I\\'m 5\\'4, and 140lbs.These are a great value and they\\'re actually really cute too. Everything was delivered as expected, no surprises. I believe I got 3 vacuum sealed 4-packs of hipsters and they all arrived in great condition. I have 5\\'10, 150lbs (carry most of my weight in my lower body) and I have a hard time finding good \"everyday\" underwear that cover just the right amount of butt cheek, don\\'t ride up, and don\\'t leave a pantyline, so I was really happy to get 12 pairs of these for $24. I would have had to spend around 50-60 bucks at target to get this many pairs of underwear, and they all fit perfect. I did get 3 packages of the same four color patterns, but that doesn\\'t really bother me the way it does some other reviewers. At my age I\\'m perfectly fine getting multiples of something that works.I ordered these a few days ago and they arrived about two days later (without Prime!) I am a 5 ft. 200+ lb woman, I wear a 16/18 pant size and this was my first time buying underwear online. I carry my weight mostly in my belly, and I have always had an issue with the fit of underwear - I was worried that the XL wouldn\\'t fit, but they did really well! They sit just below my belly, but there is no band rolling, which is something I\\'ve always had an issue with. They are thin, but comfortable and honestly it doesn\\'t feel like I\\'m wearing anything at all. In a good way!I wasn\\'t too worried about getting colors or patterns I didn\\'t like, or getting duplicates - they\\'re just underwear to me (and quite cute!) I did recieve two of the same package - light pink, pink and white stripes, black, grey, white (with black lace). They did well in the first wash and I haven\\'t had any issues with them falling apart like in some other reviews. I\\'m pretty happy so far and will buy more when needed.First, these panties are super comfortable. That\\'s the only reason I didn\\'t return them. They\\'re soft, which just the right amount of stretch to stay in place without constricting.However, as other reviewers have said, the colors probably won\\'t be as varied as the pictures show. I got three sets of the same very bland design or solid, almost neutral colors. Add in the fact that it does not fit like it looks on the model (check the fit description photo for how it actually looks on, much closer to \"granny panties\"), and I feel like I could have gotten better looking panties for cheap at Walmart or target.Again, though, these are ridiculously comfortable, so it depends what you\\'re looking for. Get them for comfort, not for cute, and be pleasantly surprised if you get more colors.They fit great! Very comfortable, and they have barely any panty lines which I appreciate. I DID get 2 out of 3 packs the same, but I don’t care. If you do, I wouldn’t recommend these because it seems to be very common to get repeats on the designs. For me though, I don’t mind at all. It would have been nice to get all different patterns,but meh, oh well. I got a small.I bought these because I wanted the occasional \"nice\" panty, even though I usually just wear cotton Hanes and I like comfort. I didn\\'t expect these to be comfortable, I just wanted to look nice and match the panties to the bras on occasion. BUT- these are really comfortable, fit really well, don\\'t ride up or fall down, and look great! I got way more than I expected to and will be buying more. The hubby likes them too.I am not sure these are the same as pictured. Way more top front material & comes up to belly button if not over.Plus they are so ridiculously small that it’s almost laughable. I wear size 7 in regular panties, but after reading reviews, decided to go all the way up to XXL & figured if too big, they’d be a gift for someone. Instead they look like a size 5 regular panty! It’s nowhere near normal sizing or even “runs small” - this is “runs don’t want any circulation to your ladybits small!”They are going back.These panties are 3 sizes too small as referenced by the Size Chart. an XL is actually...A MEDIUM OR SIZE 7 at best. Getting really tired of these chinese sellers listing items that the sizes are way way way off the scale. The sizes most on the vast majority of chinese items are for Childrens sizes Only. Not adults. Disgusting. Only way to make them listen is Don\\'t Buy Their Item until they can manufacture clothing for USAThey feel nice but they\\'re smaller than expected. I ordered an XL but they look like a medium.. They stretch so I guess it will do.It has been a few days, I have tried on it for ten days, and it feels good. I won’t be deformed after washing, and it will not fade. I will pay attention to it again.These are really pretty and silky but I ordered a large and received the XL size, so they were definitely too large for me. They are stretchy and lightweight and it seems they may expand a little in the wash, so I would perhaps, size down if you prefer a more snug fit. While these are seamless, they are definitely not invisible under clothing. Unfortunately this is probably due to the design. The panel that covers the butt area is what causes the lines to be visible under clothing. If the whole area was covered it would probably have been less visible.I ordered size large since I usually wear a size 8 in jeans. They were a little more high waisted than I thought they would be but fit comfortably. Since they are lace, I put them in a net bag to wash and hung to dry and they’ve held up well in the laundry. They came in a cute pink box that would have been perfect as a gift box had the scan bar been put on the bottom instead of the top. It doesn’t peel off easily at all. I am very pleased with the colors. The lace is soft and not itchy at all as some can be.WELL I GAVE THEM AS A GIFT AND THEY MAKE HER ASS LOOK GREAT, THEY CAME IN ON TIME AND AS THEY STATEDI always order large or extra large because i am every bit of my huge breast measurements for my top are under bust is exactly 35.5. Inches and peak bust is 44.5 inches which if i can find a bra in the correct size is 34 H or G or 36H or. G BUT THATS WISHFUL THINKING,  SO i ordered this in a large and the panties fit perfect and so does the top which is very shocking  because normally large bottoms are to big with a large top in a set because i usually buy my panties in a large 7 or 8 or most of the time a meduim size from target. This set feels great its so soft and the paties do not roll, sage or bunch up they fit just LIKE the model photograghed online. I am vert impressed and i will most definitely be buying more from this company. And so will my husband because these he really likes on me... .My man started drooling when I came out wearing this. Fits perfectly and gives a nice little tease show in the back.Fits great, and looks cute on! Bought it as a surprise and was pleased.This babydoll is so cute and sexy! Fits really well, I wear a size 16 pants and usually an XL-2X top and the XXL fit perfect! For the price you cannot beat this babydoll, I honestly want to buy another in a different color.I ordered a large.  I\\'m 5\\'3 & 155 lbs. Loved that you could adjust the straps which helped lift the \"girls\" & made them look full and perky. I have a big booty and the panties fit well.  My bf loved it!! I think it took me longer to put it on than it took him to take it off,  lol.  Loved the price and was delivered sooner than the date given.  Great purchase!I was a little skeptical at first, Im a bigger girl and to put it plain and simple almost everything i order online doesnt fit. But this,oh this is beautiful. It fits PERFECT so soft, made very very well the quaility is awesome and i feel so sexy wearing it. The color seemed a little off but i can push my OCD to the side to enjoy the nights i put this on.I love it! The rose color is darling and fits well. I\\'m a little chubby, 170 pounds, wear 38D size. I normally wear large t-shirts, but I ordered a XL. The lace bra top and panties fit perfect, only had to adjust the straps for support.I bought the purple one for my girlfriend and worried that it would look too cheap, but we both loved it! The color is a deep eggplant, not shiny, and the material is very soft to the touch. Her breasts are small but her thighs are nicely thick, so I ordered the large. She says it is comfortable to wear and likes the fit of it.Writing was cut off at the top. Very disappointed.I bought a large. It’s laughably a small. Disappointing because it was for a bridal shower n I didn’t have time to buy something different. Ended up using it for the bridal shower but obviously the bride won’t be wearing it because it won’t fit her......uugghh!Instead of an expected liner in the crotch, there is an annoying seam.Fabric is good but the print isn\\'t lined up correctly so the words are cut off. Nice and thick, totally not suitable for summer panties but more for winter or fall panties because of the thickness of the fabric. I still love them tho.Bought for a bachelorette party. Bride is size large- these are tight on me and I usually wear a size medium (size 6-7 in jeans) No way these will fit her. Quality actually seems pretty good, but sizing seems off and these are not offered in an XL- guess I’ll be returning.\\xa0I bought it for my girlfriend, she never expects I can get such cost-effective panties. The size is good, It fits her pretty well. Fabric is extremely comfy, seamless on lining makes it ultra soft, the kitty print is well done. My girlfriend washed it and dryed it, it held up so fine.She went to a fancy dress party last night, guess what, much laughter from people indicating a big fun for wearing it dancing. The highlight is the words on it shines with light no matter day or night. They are specially printed, which makes it shining even more under lights. People find no words to express their love to it, a great joke gift indeed.I bought these as a bachelorette gift. They appear to run a bit small, so I would recommend ordering one size up. They are super fun and cute and I\\'m sure they will be a hit at the party!Such a shame, because the design is really cute and looks good on the panties, but this was way too small. I think I ordered a L or an XL, whichever the biggest size was, and I could barely squeeze my butt cheeks in. Note-I am 5\\'10\\' and 160 lbs, so not really a \"curvy\" body type at all. I should have known better since many asian made products run small.Seriously, these are the best undies ever. They are thick, like swimsuit bottoms, and very comfortable. The lace is very comfortable and doesn\\'t dig in or itch. For reference I\\'m 5\\'6\" and about 130Lbs. I carry weight in my bum. I initially tried a small and they were too tight and gave me a mega muffintop. I went with the medium and I have never been so pleased with underwear in my life. Seriously, I never knew they could feel so great! They have absolute full cheek coverage and a wedgie is not something you need to worry about. I have done a ton of walking, working, working out, everything and these undies stay exactly where they\\'re supposed to. They are lower rise/hipster, which is exactly what I want and love. I have one pair or super low rise pants and the lace top of the undies pokes out, so I\\'ll either wear different undies or a longer shirt. These undies also move with you and stretch so when you bend over you don\\'t show your crack! I plan to replace all my old underwear with these hipsters as I can. The 3-pack is totally the way to go since they are the same great quality as the singles.Oh so comfortable. I put on a little weight so I got the extra large and they fit very nicely. Very well-made and comfortable, soft, airy fabric. I  will be ordering more.My husband and I share this account, so ignore the name. For the sake of the review I felt it was important to clarify that I am a woman.I purchased two packs of these in different colors. First, it\\'s important to note that these are not all the same material. One pack I received was polyester and the other was cotton. I thought I was receiving polyester per the description. I just went back to check the listing to make sure I didn\\'t miss anything and apparently I did. If you select a different style/color, the description of the underwear does NOT change until you ALSO select a size. This was an oversight on my part but was also a bit misleading. I like to be pretty active and I\\'m not a fan of how cotton underwear tends to stretch and get baggy throughout the day so I returned the cotton ones. The polyester ones are a cheaper itchier material than what I am used to. Especially for the brand. Not bad. Just OK. The size was also smaller than I expected. I usually wear an XL and have even lost 10lbs recently but these are a bit tight. Still wearable but if I were to order again, I would definitely go up a size without fear of them being too big. Overall, if you are looking for OK, basic underwear, go for it.  If you were looking for something a bit nicer, I\\'d look elsewhere.These are pretty great, I love anything with a lace waistband for keeping the muffin looking smooth. I purchased some elsewhere and was happy to find them here. However, the ones I bought elsewhere were cotton and the ad for these states that they are mostly polyester (ew). I took a chance and ordered the same color  3 pack I’d purchased in another store and they are cotton. If you’re looking for cotton I can tell you that the black, heather gray and toasted almond combo are cotton as well as the black, charcoal and pink combo. You can tell by the pictures that some of the others are actually polyester. They should change the description depending on what color combinations you choose.I wear a size 8-12 in pants and usually buy a size 7 in undies. I purchased the size large which says 7 and they pit fantastic! I love the comfort and simple yet feminine look with the lace. These will be my go to undies from now on.These are amazing! Extremely comfortable, not too tight in any area - I was most concerned about by my legs but the fit was perfect. No muffin top and they don’t sit too high on my waist. I have bought Victoria’s Secret underwear for as long as I can remember and these are 10x more comfortable for half the price. Will be buying more!These panties are awesome! I ordered a size 2xl/9. I’m postpartum and my stomach is much larger than usual. I love the waistband. I find that some panties roll down on my belly right now but not these. They stay put and I love the lace around the waistband. It’s a thick, comfortable lace that stays in place and isn’t scratchy or irritating. These panties are so comfy and I feel like they give me some much needed support after my c section. I’ve included pictures with measurements. If you found this useful, please click the helpful button 😉Fabric is very soft and stretchy. Bottoms, I\\'m in between an XL and 2xl in certain things. 5\\'9 190lbs with bigger hips, butt, and thighs. I ordered a 2x and they fit great. Not tight what so ever. So comfy and smooth. The patterns are pretty. I will order again. They fit my body perfect.These have been my bra of choice for many years, but finding my size at the store is near impossible with my size 42 D. I am 5\\'3 and 140 and they are true to size and very consistent. Sometime you see quality go down with brands over time but these remain tried and true. These give great lift and build beautiful and full cleavage. The plunging center makes it perfect to wear with a lower but shirt with out your bra being in sight. This is a 2 hook bra,but has a wider band that does not roll together or bunch. I have had no issues with the underwire breaking through ever. I will confess that I do machine wash these and put them in the dryer which causes the jewel in the center to fall off but that is my fault. Even with the machine washing they never lose their shape. I\\'ve had a few of these in my draw for a few years unwilling to part with them. I will continue to be brand loyal.If my review helped you, please click the helpful button. Or comment if I can answer any other questions <3The bra over all is VERY comfortable. However, the huge issue is the torpedo chest it gave me. Not the soft round shape in the modeled images or the other costumer review images. Not a huge fan of having two pointy mountains under my shirt that not only poke out weird, but also head east and west rather than straight out. I bought another style from this company thinking it was maybe just the one I got stuck with. Nope. Cockeyed bullet bra. I can\\'t say I\\'ve had such bad luck before, but what do I expect at such a low price? Eh, two more bras to toss in the \"only to be worn at home\" pile. :(I purchased one to try, because I wasn\\'t having much luck finding bras that I liked. I love the fit of this one so much, that I purchased 4 more in different colors. They are comfortable to me, and hold their shape with washing. I wash them in a machine, in a garment bag, and hang dry. So misshapen cups! I do get the occasional loose string from the lace, but not bad. I\\'ll probably get one in each color.I HATE shopping for bras. I usually get aggravated going through so many different ones in a regular store that I just settle and regret it later. However, I decided to take the time to order a few different ones and try them at home. This one was the clear winner- by far! I went back and ordered three other colors and I\\'m just waiting for the nude one to come back in stock. These fit so well! There\\'s no pinching or squeezing and they look good both with a shirt and without. I hate having a bra that looks awesome then putting a shirt on and it looks like I have one giant boob or pointed! The look and feel great and are now by go-to bras.First off, I\\'ll be ordering more colors soon. I typically wear bras with absolutely zero padding, but with summer upon us I wanted something with a little pick me up that was also fine for everyday wear. The fit is excellent. I don\\'t usually wear padded bras because my boobs just tend to fall out the middle or have to be readjusted all day. This is padded for lift and not shoving the girls together. The padding only sits under the breast and I feel like the rest is thin enough padding that I\\'m not faking something I don\\'t have on my own. Great, great bra.I love this bra!!  I expected less for the price. But it\\'s beautifully comfortable!!  He lived it also, its very sexy and gives the girls a great lift!!  I want one in every color. Seriously as good as some of my VS bras. I hope it holds up well. If your considering buying it, just go for it. I don\\'t think you\\'ll be disappointed.I wear a size 40C and ordered that size. This bra looks absolutely beautiful and washed well in the washer on gentle cycle in a lingerie bag. I turned the bra inside out also so that the lace was on the inside instead. {There were other clothes also in the washer at the same time}. The bra is really pretty and seems well made.The cup size is a bit large even though it is padded. I wore it and spent the entire day adjusting the straps and trying to get the bra band to stay down. So, the band could have been too large {I lost 5 pounds between buying it and wearing it}, but the sides cut into me and I would not order a smaller size because of that. This is truly the most uncomfortable bra that I have ever worn.It was very annoying in so many ways. The lace is very scratchy even though it was washed before wearing. The side wires really dig in, but the cups were larger than expected.The bra rode up constantly and just didn\\'t fit or feel right. It is like it stretched from the time I put it on until I took it off. Weird.It is an adorable bra and if it didn\\'t have those issues would be a 4 or 5 star bra for how well it is made. As it is though... three stars as I really hate it, but added a star for it being well made and  I also love all the different colors that this bra comes in.  Sad that it didn\\'t work out because of the fit and it being so uncomfortable and scratchy. I would not recommend this bra. I purchased the hot pink one also and it is getting returned.I bought this bra because I purchased a white blouse for job interviews and realized I had only dark colored bras. I am blown away by how great this bra is. It fits perfectly, has comfortable straps, and the perfect amount of padding. It\\'s also quite beautiful and my confidence gets a little boost from wearing it. It\\'s a steal for the price and could easily pass for a $50 bra. I will be getting more of these!I bought the red one. It’s really comfortable and smooth. I like this color is kind of sexy ^^, and not heavy,it’s suitable for summer too. Price is good for this quality.i think I may get anther one again.They ran a little bit on the large side and the material is not soft and silky it’s very scratchy .  The design the material the look of the material is pretty but I am returning itThe wife loved it!!! Complete winner! She said it was a great fit with the extender for when you are a half size larger in the bra. Also, the fabric and the lace were very sexy! The panties looked very nice and were so sexy on her. But...the fact that she wanted more of these in different colors tells the true story. She looks forward to ordering more!I have bought both the red & black set as well as the pink set and plan on getting more. These are comfortable, fit well, and supportive! I have washed mine several times with no issues, I do not dry them however, I always lay bras out flat to dry.  I would recommend these to anyone!Super comfy and super sexy. I love how I feel in this and it pushes my chest up nicely.I bought this for the nice look of the bra.  The bra is a little pointed, so for this reason I only use this behind closed doors.  It is a good deal and worth the money.Bra had fuzz and string all over it like it had been worn. Underwear is all ready separating from the lace. Like someone too big tried them on and ripped the material.Bought for my wife for a recent trip.  They appeared to fit fine and looked great for the short time she had them on.... if you know what I mean.Over the past several months I\\'ve been working on losing weight and finally got to a point where my underwear was too big. I saw these and wasn\\'t sure if they\\'d fit, but they were so cute I figured trying a pair would be a nice treat or an incentive to keep up the good work. They arrived and fit perfectly. Their fit and quality remind me of that ubiquitous world-famous brand; I\\'m sure you know what i mean😉 I plan to keep getting a pair or two as motivation.I would highly recommend this brand to a friend!This is my second purchase rom sofishie and I\\'m thouroughly impressed. Being plus size I\\'ve had a hard time especially shopping but this brand had really boosted my confidence. The pair of panties I purchased have a nice stretch and didn\\'t fall apart on a tug test. I\\'m 5\\'2\" a d 220lbs purchased an XL and it fits great I typically run 16/18 in pant sizes to give you an idea.I mean it looks cute but made for a mannequin! They fit perfectly the only problem was the elastic is so cheap they slide right off. LolThese are the closest to right-sized of any of a nine-item order. And they\\'re sure to please as they are used.As soon as I got them I knew they are perfect. And they are. I would wear them under a short skirt and be comfortable.I purchased a size large and they fit perfectly.  I usually wear a size 10-12. Very comfy.these are so cute and well made  I was surprised at how well made they are  considering the price!!  Plus there comfortable.I\\'m an avid believer that some buyers may not love these due to the difference in material compared to another manufacturer. Not as soft as I expected but still good.So sexy, very good quality!!! I got the medium. I am 5\\'2\" 130lbsFits great and very sexy !I\\'m usually a five to a seven and the large fit great!! Beach bound!!Wife loves them and said are more comfortable than most of her other short shorts to sit in. She got many stares wearing them out the first time she wore.Looks as the picture shows.. maybe a TAD bit small, but i guess that\\'s the idea lol. Im 5\\'6\" about 140 and ordered a medium.  Hubby likes them ;)excelente muy girlfriens verte happy AND super hoy hotCute for fun beach party themeThese shorts are perfect! I ordered Medium I am 5\\'6\" 117lbs. They are so comfortable and easy to move in.I have finally found the perfect thongs. Practically impossible to find thongs without seems. This will be TMI, but hemroids run in the family and occasionally I would get irritation from regular thongs. The rubbing was just too much. I wore these for the first time today and no running, to riding, no irritation. They look great too. I will have to order more of these and find the bikini version too. Highly recommend, especially for those that need a seemless fit not only in the sides but on the underside as well. Some mentioned these feeling flimsy and poorly made with poor quality material. I don’t agree. Obviously hand wash in the sink and they will last. I’ve attached a comparison between a pair with underside seem and this brand. Super comfortable!!!!!!Perfect! I was looking for something similar to the VS sport thongs and these are it! If you want the same barely-there feel these are perfect- super thin for under leggings and to the gym wear! Got a small, I’m 5’4 and 130-athletic build and they’re perfect. Stretchy but not too stretchy. I live in leggings and athletic clothes so I’m happy they come in a 6 pack for a decent price too!!I am 5\\'5 145lbs, usually a size 4 in pants. I ordered a large and they are just a smidge big.Nice material, I would compare them to the VS laser cut thong in terms of feel and how they lay under clothes, not micro or seamless, but just as good.These are exactly what a no show / invisible thong panty should be. They fit as expected and are made out of silky, soft material. They are true no show ever under leggings, and they stay up without digging into your hips to do so. And, they’re truly tagless, which makes them all the more comfortable. Love, love, love...will definitely buy again. (Wealurre - PLEASE make the same set in a nude color!)God bless Amazon for delivering me these thongs after I realized I packed only TWO pair of underwear for a two week vacation. I have a lot of nicer thongs from Nordstrom and I honestly reach for these more. They are super comfortable and lay really nicely under clothing. They are great for workouts and aren’t visible under leggings.These are the sofest, most comfortable underwear I have ever owned. When I first put them on it was like wearing air.  I wanted to love them but unfortunately about half way through the day they sort of made their way up into the wedgie position and that\\'s where they wanted to stay.  If the actual reinforced crotch area was a little thicker or strctured, these would be my go to undies forever. Sadly, I just can\\'t deal with floss in my nether regions.  I am 5\\'2\" and 116 lbs and small (at leadt initially) fit perfect.  If anyone has some tips for keeping these \"in place\", I\\'d love to hear them.Update:  I have updated my rating because their customer service was absolutely awesome.  They reached out to me after my review and I felt they were honestly concerned about my satisfaction.  They offered to refund my purchase and said they would take my comments in future product improvements.  Again, if these work for you, they are awesome.  If not, the customer service is great and they stand behind their product.My first time bought it, i would want to say that is a good try, very soft and comfortable, and sexy!I bought the 6 package bundle in Size M, Waist 26 - Hips 32, This the softest underwear I have, I can wear them high or low on my hip.I washed them a lot and the quality is amazing, bright colors, soft, did not shrink. I like that the underwear do not dig in my skin/mark. I was concerned with the crotch area on the picture, it seemed too thin, however it\\'s soft and durable and thick enough.I highly recommend and will buy soon!These are my first thoughts/impressions  on these booty lifting shape wear panties. Once I’ve worn them for the event I’m going to, I’ll update:*Surprisingly cute. Husband Man approves and appreciates, as do I. The stretch lace cheeks are comfy and pretty.*Tough but not too tight feeling waist band and sturdy stitching.  The material definitely holds and smooths, I don’t think the waist band will roll or slide down any.*There was some butt liftage. Nothing crazy, but things look perkier in the derrière area.*Material is warm, but breathes.Now, I’m not sure if I would call these negatives, but they might cause a love/hate relationship:*I’m not sure if I should have gone up a size or not, but the back rolls are out in their full glory. Tummy - nice and smooth, no muffin top. Back - oh dear lord. I may have to wear a smoothing cami in addition to these. I feel like they could have gone higher up 2 or 3 inches. I don’t think if I had gone a size up it would have mattered or I wouldn’t have had the same perfect-for-me tummy control.*The leg holes are aaaaaaalmost too tight. Not uncomfortable, but I think I would have to wear these for a little while before I wasn’t constantly aware of the leg of these in the inner thigh crease.*Be aware that the lace has a ‘nude’ lining. I didn’t even notice at first because it matches my skin tone very well. Just don’t want anyone to be shocked that their behind is suddenly a different hue.UPDATE: added a fourth star: I ended up wearing these yesterday at work to make sure they were going to do their job at the wedding I’m attending. I wore them with a smoothing cami for about 11 hours.  There was absolutely NO sliding or rolling down.  My cami wanted to scrunch up when worn over the panty, so I ended up tucking the cami into the panty and everything stayed in place. For the first few hours, the legs were a little uncomfortable (I sit at a desk all day), but they did eventually stretch out a bit.All day and I didn’t feel overheated, I didn’t feel overly squished.  I’m thoroughly happy with this shape wear and have already ordered more from this company!>>> I am 5’5” and 235 lbs.  I carry my weight in my tummy,  thighs and boobs <<< I bought the black buttlifter in size 2XLI bought this to wear under my bridesmaid\\'s dress for my best friend\\'s wedding and it felt and looked great! I know that pant sizes and all that jazz are funky wherever you go (perks of buying women\\'s clothes... NOT), so I\\'m going to tell you that I\\'m a size 10/12 (I fluctuate depending on time-of-the-month) in American Eagle \"Denim X\" super-stretch, high-waisted jeans. I\\'ve bought shapewear before that was too big, which doesn\\'t help anybody, so I figured I\\'d buy a size or two smaller than what the size chart said. Apparently, I should be a 3XL, but I ended up buying an XL and it fit well! A little right, sure, but I wanted it that way to help keep everything \"locked and loaded.\" What I love about this shaper is that it\\'s super cute! I mean, it\\'s not like anyone was going to see it anyway, but I felt pretty wearing it. Most shapers are ugly with no flare or anything to it. This shaper has a more lingerie-type look, which honestly helped to boost my confidence. I still wear this shaper whenever I wear dresses. Definitely give it a try, but be sure to consider how \"tightly packed\" you want to feel in it. Again, remember that I wanted mine tight, so I bought 2 sizes smaller than what size the chart says I should have. If that\\'s not your thing, I\\'d go for 1 size smaller than recommended for a more relaxed fit that\\'ll still hold you together. I feel like buying \"true\" size wouldn\\'t help, but that\\'s just me. Hope this helped!I lovveee this! I ordered a medium (I\\'m a size 8) and it fits perfect! Very slimming and a huge confidence booster!I\\'m 321lbs. 5\\'9\" and I\\'ve been searching for a bodyshaper/girdle with padded butt and haven\\'t had any luck until now. This item isn\\'t padded but the butt lifter for this product works in place of the pads. It fits perfect and comfortable being I\\'m full figured and need some support. I ordered a 3xxxl I wear size 22 jeans, I would recommend this item. I hope this review is helpful for our full figured women.I absolutely love this product. It is true to size and does exactly what it says. It gave my butt the lift the description described. I would purchase this product again and highly recommend it to anyone looking to lift their butt and tone their tummy. Can you say two for one!!!!Item fit comfortably.  It was not tight or painful like most shapers.It will smooth nicely under my clothes.I like the cooling panel.It is still sexy enough to avoid being embarrassed in front of a partner.4 stars only because I would have liked a little more tummy control...i ordered a 3xl, so it could be that the item was a little too big, or that i would have had to sacrifice comfort.  I would purchase again.Buy this product! The day I received my first one, I tried it on and ordered another. The quality was consistent. I ordered another in a different color. I love this product. I already have a butt so I don\\'t need anything to make it bigger. It doesn\\'t make it bigger but it gives it a shape that I love. I was walking today and kept looking at my butt because I love the way it looks with it on. My husband thinks it is regular underwear because that\\'s what it looks like. It doesn\\'t have the shapewear look or feel which initially scared me but let me assure you, I have going to Macy\\'s for 13 years consistently buying a particular brand of shapewear while it gave me the same shape as this one, this one is far more comfortable. I was paying $60 a piece. I can\\'t stress enough how much I really love it. I am an average consumer. I didn\\'t get anything from this company for a review. I just wanted to share with other women who may want something to hide a bulge or shape a butt. I finally found out that shapewear doesn\\'t have to squeeze the breath out of me or give me abrasions to look good. It\\'s not expensive enough to feel like you wasted your money if you don\\'t like it but I think you will love it.Fabric: The fabric was surprisingly soft for a lace item. I was expecting it to be a little scratchy, but none of that was present! It was very smooth and soft.Cost vs. Quality: I feel that this was a good buy for the price. Could it look more luxurious? Sure, but I would expect to pay much more.Fit: The back was perfect. It was very flattering and made me feel confident. The front could use a little more coverage, however.Overall: This was the first time I have ever purchased clothing on Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised. The cost was right, the fit was right, and it was something I would wear regularly.Bought it for my wife as a gift, it fits very well. the pants very comfortable the waistband is perfect and it\\'s a thicker material, worth to buy. love it!Due to being made in China I sized up. They fit true to size, run slightly large. I usually wear a medium in underwear purchased from US department stores. I ordered a large. They are big on me. I’m not narrow framed. I am curvey, especially my hips and butt. Wished I ordered my usual size. They are stretchy so if worried about being tight, don’t be..  I’m 5’2” and about 125-130 lbs., if this helps.I have huge hips and a big butt. These fit almost perfect. They look amazing and my boyfriend went INSANE when he saw me wear them. I’ve already recommended them to a few friends and I’d totally buy again.I bought these to spice up my marriage. they are cute. They fit true to size it’s not something I’d wear all day but they do the job.I love them and so do my husbandI love these...and so does my husband. I was nervous about them being too small so I ordered the next size up and they ended up being a larger than I expected.I have a rounder booty than some and my Honey LOVES it. We are going on a trip in a couple weeks so I wanted to get a little something to wear that he would like and found these and am pairing them with a little red nighty and they are exactly what I wanted! They are super cute on the booty and really comfortable too! They aren\\'t exactly the same shade of red as the nighty but I am pretty sure he wont care lol.Good product! BUT.....TERRIBLE that they print what you ordered on the mailing label !!! Like “sexy underwear” so everyone sees on the outside of the package what you bought!!!For the price the quality is outstanding. Shipping came very quickly from somewhere in Asia. Soft fabric, stretchable, and looks fantastic on a fat ass. The open cheek view is eye-catching to say the least.I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t notice these aren\\'t sized when I bought them. They fit like a medium but I\\'m a large so they dont really way too tight. They would look amazing if I could buy my size though and they aren\\'t a bad qualityBeautiful but fragileLove! Super hot!Great fit and stretchy to fit big or small , extreamly sexyWay to smallvery sexy undies for night with baegreat panties. I have a big butt and thighs. they don\\'t ride up, leaves room in crotch. tmi? maybe. but someone needs to hear this.Basic and without embellishments, these high-cut briefs are made from 95 percent cotton and 5 percent elastane for breathability and stretch. Very comfortable to wear, the construction eliminates bunching or riding up and they are tag-less.  The fabric is finely woven and very soft. Appealing in its simplicity the undergarment is finished with delicate 1/4 inch hems at the leg holes and waistline.Fabric care is reasonably non-fussy. Machine wash warm with like colors on delicate cycle and tumble dry low heat. No iron or bleach. I am usually between a medium and large but because of the cotton content I went up a size in the event of significant shrinkage but that was not necessary.After laundering, they looked as good as when I put them in the wash and shrinkage was minimal with 3/8 inch in length and 1/4 inch in height. Sizing is correct and since shrinkage is not an issue, next time I would select my usual size.The basic assortment is made up of neutral colors and includes black and white horizontal stripe, black, grey, beige and two pairs of white. Very compact, so besides usual daily use they would be excellent to pack when traveling. If necessary, they could be hand washed easily drying overnight. Modestly priced, functional and subtly feminine.Cotton stretch undies with tape elastic are weirdly hard to find anymore (at least in my size), but these fit the bill nicely. Usually I wear a 9 o 10 in underwear so I bought these in an XXL (I am \"plus size\" usually wearing a size 20 in pants and dresses) Great generous cut, with the perfect rise, full coverage back and a just right cut leg. Took off one star because while the fabric is soft and comfortable it is a bit on the thin size, which honestly isn\\'t unexpected. Might order these in the basic colors too if the multi print pack holds up over the next few months. I will say, the blue stripey ones are a little on the cheap looking side, but the rest are cute. Beware, the coral ones are very bright (edging towards neon) peachy orange coral, not the muted sort of dusky coral in the photos. The rest are accurate colors.I normally get all-cotton panties in this style, so when I saw these 95% cotton ones much cheaper than the name brand ones I usually get, I thought they\\'d be worth a try.  My first impression was that, although they are soft, they don\\'t feel like cotton at all.  They\\'re much stretchier.  That\\'s not necessarily a down side, and they\\'re quite comfortable to wear without riding up.  However, if you wear them with pantiliners, pads, etc., the adhesive will NOT stick to this fabric.  The crotch area is the same slick, stretchy fabric as the rest of the panty.  For that reason, I wouldn\\'t purchase them again, but I\\'ll continue to wear this set.  One other small issue is that the \"tagless\" label in the back is bulky enough that you can feel it on the outside.  I\\'m concerned that it may start peeling off in the wash and become uncomfortable.These are seriously a surprise to me. I was expecting low quality, but I was surprised to find how well these are made. Shipping was fast. These are not see-through, and made of durable material. I am very very happy with my purchase and will buy more later on. I am a size 14 in jeans, 5\\'11 210lbs and ordered XLI was pleasantly surprised by these undies. Often when I buy high leg briefs, they either fit too high or too low on the waist, or too large in the rear. I no longer even try to buy Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, or any other multi-pack undies typically found in stores, because the fit is always terrible. I thought I was doomed to buy overpriced Victoria\\'s Secret briefs forever, since they are some of the only ones I\\'ve ever found that fit me properly. I feel like I am neither short or long waisted, so I don\\'t understand why there are so many fit issues with what should be basic undies. These fit perfectly, though! They reach just underneath my belly button, so I wouldn\\'t call them granny panties, but they aren\\'t bikinis, either. These are how high leg briefs should always fit, in much opinion. I didn\\'t notice any shrinkage at all when washed in cold water and dried on low heat. They are holding up very well so far and appear to be very good quality. No issues with wedgies or sliding around, either. Very comfortable!I wear a size 14 in pants, and ordered size XL. I\\'m sure they could also fit a size 16, as I\\'m currently 4 months pregnant and they still fit great.These are super comfy which coming from a very picky gal on comfort is saying a lot. I got the xl but could have gotten away with the large as they have good stretch as well. I do wish they came in six packs where you could just order the black ect by itself but all in all the value and fit was worth it. Unfortunately, my black pair came with a manufacturers defect in the crotch. Part of the fabric didn\\'t get sewn or got torn. I\\'ll try to include a picture. I haven\\'t gotten to investigate the rest of the set but its a fairly decent sized hole. Otherwise, I\\'m happy with these and they\\'re suprisingly cute.These are the most comfortable underwear I\\'ve ever owned. The material is so soft and thin (not too thin though!) Some of the seams are decently crooked on a few pairs so it makes the garment slide out place a bit but not too bad to be annoying. I recommend these to any (and all) of my mom friends or clients that need something high waisted, secure, and comfortable. If I could get rid of all my undies except these (and a few sexy pairs, cuz..ya know, gotta keep the spark alive) I totally would. Buy these. You won\\'t be disappointed if you like high waisted underpants!Order UP a Size!  These run Small!  I always wear a Medium, but had to order these in a Large.  Large worked.  My measurements hip measurement is 38\" and I weigh 132 lbs.I recently purchased these for my wife as a sexy fun gift for her to wear. Well, unfortunately she isn\\'t the thong type, she\\'s more the commando type. They looked good, great, amazing when she tried them on for me thou.  Even if she isn\\'t going to be wearing them on a daily basis or even a regular basis, they are made of beautiful colored lace. The cut is high on the cheeks, which is very sexy! I would recommend this product indeed.These were actually better than I anticipated. No, the quality isn\\'t all that great, there were some loose strings, and on the pink one, the waistband had been folded over and stitched to itself, and I can almost guarantee you\\'ll need to hand wash them, because they do seem fairly delicate. That said, they ended up being really cute, and relatively comfortable. As per other reviews, I did order up a size. I normally wear a small, but I ordered a medium. They actually fit really well. I was afraid they\\'d be too loose, but they\\'re snug without being tight.I am very happy with the selection of colors I received. I was looking for some sexy thong undies that isn\\'t made of strings behind. I got  the real deal right here and I am so impressed with them. Please note that these do run small.so you can size up a bit if you are not very slim.they look good, don\\'t stretch too well thoughThese are insanely small and I ordered her a size up, and they are about falling apart the seems are barely sewn. Are these supposed to be for barbies dolls? It’s a shame because these would be super sexy if they fit and didn’t come pre unraveled :( look elsewhere would be my advice to anyone considering the purchase.Very cute and fit nice I usually take a medium USA size 7 but thought if they came from China they would be to small glad I brought an XL fit fine. Colors are as bright as pictured. Would recommend them.super comfy and cute, I wish the middle was a little shorter, but I have a weird body shape (wide from a frontal view, narrow from the side) so it\\'s just my body.They are very comfortable. Sometimes you want a high waisted underwear.I know I prefer that when I wear higher waisted pants or skirts, it just feels better to me. These are breathable and are soft. The colors are nice too. They fit pretty true to size for me.I’m a fan of the “cheeky” undies. These have a great design, that shows just enough cheek, but is comfortable as well. They have good stretch (a bit small, but good motivation!) and the cotton panel makes them breathable.This review is for the Multi-color 6pcs size small. These bikinis hugs low on the hips. I’m usually a x-small and small fits me, so I would recommend that you go up a size or two or follow the chart for sizing.Love the underwear very nice style. But I wish I would have ordered a size bigger. I already ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear. I guess I\\'ll just lose a couple poundsThese undies are sooo cute!! They did come a little small for a size smal (BUT NOT TOO SMALL) just fit a little snug - no muffin top or anything. I love the see through lace 😏😏😏😏These are truly sexy and very comfortable! Arrived packaged well, each underwear is individually packed which I like very much. Seems very durable and nice material!These panties are pretty and fit as described. The designs are gorgeous and the material is breathable. Highly recommended.it is definitely sized wrong I wear a medium and these are almost extra smallI always have a hard time purchasing panties in general never mind adding the online aspect which always make things even more difficult. I wanted to make sure that these would fit comfortably and not ride up and give me wedgies all day. I decided to order a medium. I am 5\\'3\" 130lbs I usually wear a size 4 / 6 in pants and a small or medium. I am actually very surprised at how comfy these are. I usually get my panties from vs and I actually feel these are made better. The vs ones are all lace in the back and the lace rips. These are lace also however there is a sheer liner which stops and holes from being made. Happy with my purchase!I think these are beautiful to look at. The colors are rich and don\\'t fade in the wash. But they are a little pinchy at the waist and leg holes - the elastic doesn\\'t give as much as I\\'d like for it to be comfortable. The lace can itch, especially where there\\'s also elastic, but really a solid lace panty isn\\'t really a choice made for comfort! Definitely a date night staple in my house.I was a little worried to order online without seeing the fabric in person but I was NOT disappointed. Not only these are very pretty but they are also comfortable. I wear them with jeans and these do not show at all. Great alternative to wear instead of thongs. I like the fact that it has all the different colors you might need for lighter and darker pants. I will be getting a second set of these.No show underwear is one of the most important features to me when I shop for undergarments. Luckily, I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. I do like that the pack of 6 comes with different colors, which is helpful for different color outfits. They’re surprisingly comfortable (considering the lace) and look good at the same time. Not itchy and true to size.I absolutely love these panties. Inwas looking to upgrade my panties because well basically im.a mom and the last in the house for new underwear. These panties are so comfie. The material is super soft and not scratchy at all the waste has good stretch to it. They seem to hold up in the wash well I like them. The patern is super cute.I searched for days to find some really pretty lacy underwear to go with the new bras I was going to purchase (also from Amazon). So glad I found these! They came in and the colors almost matched up to the bras perfectly. The underwear is comfortable with a mesh lining so you\\'re not scratched by the lace. Super sexy with the bras!I love these underwear. They fit me so well and they don’t leave any lines! There is a cotton liner which is really appreciated. They don’t dig into my hips either. I ordered a large and typically wear a large and they fit perfectly.These underwear are super comfy! The material is sturdy and silky smooth and also holds up in the washer! The designs imprinted are very elegant. The fit is as expected and feels like I don’t have anything on at all!! Will be buying more!!These were my size but were pretty tight when I got them. Had to send them back. Beware- they run at least 1 maybe 2 sizes small.Nice look for the price, comfortable, stay in place.An affordable, comfortable pair of real panties that cover what they need to while still making you feel sexy! Ordering more soon!I like these a lot, however, the colors I ordered were not the same as I received. Also, the placement of the very sturdy tag on the front bow makes it nearly impossible to remove it without also removing the bow. I lost a bow on one pair while trying.soft, comfortable, and body conforming!its ok and they are comfortableNice. I even ordered more.Love these!  Will be ordering more!I like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitVery nice pantie , fit is perfect, good coverage. Low rise is nice. If you’re small like me . 5’6 / 128 lbs . The small fit perfect.All of these underwear unraveled in the wash. (See picture)I wish I could return them.Received my order today and was thrilled with the fit. Just finished washing them and spent 5 minutes unraveling a rat\\'s nest trying to figure out the source. Found that it was one of these pairs of underwear that came undone at the seam in 10 different places. I\\'m not even sure if this pair is even salvageable at this point. All the others are still intact for now, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if this happens to all the others.Soft and fit well. Just make sure to wash on delicate setting with other intimatesLoved the colors, loved the fabric, but one wash in and completely unraveled :( hoping the others will hold up and they a was a fluke.These panties fit exactly as I needed. It’s very hard to find a good pair of panties in a store or online.Ami esposa le quedan muy bonitosA lil small but love em but a bit pricey!They were a few pairs missing when I received the package. They’re also not that comfortableI got a pretty cute variety (not as varied as I’d hoped) and they’re good quality for the price, though I guess time will tell that for sure. My only complaint is that I usually wear a Large in panties (at Target for example) and these are definitely much smaller. I got the ones with the lacy trim which I love. I’m shedding pounds so they should fit at some point, but I’d recommend ordering a size up!I bought the mediums and they run true to size. For reference, I\\'m pear-shaped with a big butt at 34\" around my hip bones and 42\" around the widest part of my butt. That makes me both a medium and a large in US sizes at the same time, so I never know which to buy. Since a thong usually goes ::ahem:: inbetwixt the cheeks, I usually go with the smaller size which worked out well in this case. My weight and size also tend to yoyo a lot, but these are so stretchy and breathable that I think they will work well for a variety of weights, sizes, and body types which is a huge plus.If you\\'re on the fence about what size to get, I would suggest ordering the size you normally wear. If you\\'re in between sizes and most of your girth is in your butt, I would go with the smaller size. If you\\'re in between and most of your girth is in your hips and belly, I would go with the larger size.The fabric is listed as 95% cotton and 5% spandex. They are very thin which makes them super breathable and comfortable even on hot days, but because of that the lighter colors are pretty much sheer and I could see these wearing out or developing holes in a pretty short period of time. I don\\'t anticipate them lasting more than a year. But for this price, there are going to be some consessions. They also have a gusset, which I prefer and find more comfortable.The only thing I was really dissapointed about were the colors. I wasn\\'t deterred by the \"random assortment\" because I liked all of the colors pictured. Unfortunately, the colors I received aren\\'t any of the ones pictured. I got 2 packs with 5 pairs in each, both with the same assortment (lame). But the colors are all light pink and coral pastel patterns that I would never have picked and the white trim makes them look like little girls\\' underoos. They remind me of the packs of Disney panties I would get as a kid. Fine for a tween or teen, but at my age it feels a bit creepy. I\\'m not going to return them because I need new thongs and the price is right... but I definitely won\\'t be wearing these on date night. That alone is why I won\\'t be repurchasing these.I was unclear how the fit would be for these, since most XL thong style undies tend to be too baggy in the lady bits and super tight on the hip bands. However, these fit perfect, and actually super comfy. There is no sagging and they hold up well in the wash with no shrinkage. I\\'m 184 pounds and 5\\'2, and the XLs are perfect.These are mostly just fine. I ordered a Medium ( I am 150 lbs and 5\\' 5\" ). I think they run just a tad large. If you like a more snug fit, think about sizing down. If you like a more comfortable/lose fit, then order your normal size.In my ten pack, I received two each of the same color so I only received five different colors. The sizing was as expected. I had to wash them twice before use because there was a strong chemical smell to them. They came in two bags of five and as soon as you opened each bag, the smell hit you. Not a huge deal as I would have washed them anyway but I had to wash them twice to get the smell out. They are super comfortable, though. I would buy them again if I could get a variety of colors.Pretty solid for an online underwear buy. The material feels thick enough to last but also has a good stretch and breathes well. They are pictured in the groups they came in. Four in one bag and six in the other. Unfortunately not all different colors as pictured/expected and comes with a couple repeats in the least desirable colors (like the one that looks like a terrible tie pattern). They also run just a smidge large so if you like having snug underwear you could order down a size. Still worth it given the price and quality.I first received the incorrect brand of underwear and had to return and reorder. Received the colors pictured and they are in no way any of what is pictured ok the product page. I\\'m tired of having to go through the process of returning and reordering so I\\'m just going to stick with what I have. Product fits as expected but just be ready to roll the dice on what design/color you\\'ll receive.These are awful, I\\'m returning them. Using Google Translate, I can see the printed tag says 82% nylon, 18% spandex. There\\'s no cotton anywhere, not even at the crotch, so they\\'re not breathable. Ordered XS, package says S, underwear says M. They\\'re cheap dollar store panties, cost is too high.It is pretty soft and comfortable. I like its tagless design. It prints the content inside the underware instead of using a tag.These are super cute! I thought they\\'d end up looking cheaper in person but it\\'s the opposite. They look super pretty. Normally I like a bit more cheek showing but I think I might just keep buying these instead! They cover plenty but still look really good because of the backside being entirely lace. Also they are comfy which is great too :) I was worried they wouldn\\'t fit right but I\\'m 5\\'8\", 112lbs, fall within the XS measurements on their chart and the XS fits me perfect!there is nothing I dislike, they are easy to wash and air-dry, comfortable fir=t, material feels pleasant.I was extremely pleased when I received these panties. They fit perfectly and don\\'t ride up at all.  Material is soft to touch. It\\'s like not wearing anything. My favorite panties in the drawer. I\\'m 5\\'6\" And 150#. My waist is 33\"and I ordered a medium.Very prettyWell madeGreat valueIt’s exactly what’s expected, but a bit on the larger size. I would recommend getting one size smaller than what you normally would get, so even if it ends up being a lil snug it’s stretchy enough that it’ll fit better than being saggy.i bought these panties for my husband, there is plenty of room in front and and stretchy too, the little back looks like a lacy butterfly with very lite coverage in back. he loves them and i luv them on him. they look really sexy on him! these are so much better than male underwear. ladies buy these for your husband you will both luv them! i buy his clothes now and his favorite color is pink.For the price I wasn’t expecting much BUT actually was very impressed with these lace thong panties. In all seriousness, these are basically the same as Victoria’s Secret and way cheaper. I have been a loyal VS customer for this exact type of panties but the amazon ones are a game changer for me.I ordered Medium and received 3 Medium, 2 Small and 1 with no tag at all. No one checked the package when putting this togetherLove these!! I usually buy from Victoria\\'s Secret,but their prices are always high and not such great quality. These panties were cheaper and better quality. I put them on and fell in love! So happy!! Will be buying them again soon!!I like the price/color options. Lace is very thin and can dig into sides which leaves for an unflattering look. Pretty much turns into a G-string by it folding/rolling.These run ultra big, they’re ok if you’re into hiking them up to your belly and wedgiesI’m always a size M in department store thongs & underwear and the size M was perfect and fit as expected. The quality is great too!Not great, but not terrible. Definitely not nice enough for a sexy date night, but good enough for everyday underwear when all your fav\\'s are in the laundry. Soft and comfortable enough.Sexy, open in all the right places and elegant. Can\\'t wait to surprise my BF with them. Fits nicely. Great value for the money.I read others reviews stating these run a bit small. I wear a medium in Victoria\\'s Secret, so I ordered these in a large and they fit perfectly. The material is very soft and comfortable, the lace is elegant and sexy, the husband is happy. I would definitely recommend to a friend!I have not washed or worn these yet, but so far I am pleased. They are very pretty; I love the colors. The material is very soft. The price is much better than what I would pay Target or someplace similar. I am 5\\'4\" 120 lbs, and I got a medium to ensure that they did not dig at all. They fit exactly like I was hoping, just skimming my skin. Size small probably could have fit me, but it possibly could have cut into my sides, creating bulges under clothes, so I went with the medium instead. These are more of a low-rise fit instead of coming high up over the hip bone like some do. All in all, I\\'m happy!AMAZING! In love and I will most likely purchase again. I am usually a small, but after reading the reviews I got a size up and they fit perfectly. They are super cute and comfy.The bows fell off while only wearing them once, and the tags completely disentegrated after one wash. The company said I must have received a bad batch and said they would refund me, but haven’t gotten a refund yet...These thongs are so soft and comfortable it feels like you\\'re not wearing any underwear!  Very sexy!  I just hope they stand up to the wash!  They run a bit small, so I bought L as I usually buy M.  The Ls are a great fit!  On the face of it, they look a bit flimsy, so I hope they stand up to washing!These are incredibly soft! They looked tiny but actually fit perfectly! They don’t ride, they’re extremely comfortable and a great priceThey run just a little bit small.  I usually wear a small, so I ordered a medium - and even after washing/drying, they\\'re a little snug.  Not unwearable, but somewhat uncomfortable after a full day of wear.I love these underpants. Very comfy and cute. I like my underwear a little looser so I got a medium, but they have good stretch so I would recommend staying true to size. (I’m 5’4 ~125lbs. Usually wear S/M)So I will start off by saying I am very picky about my underwear - it must be (mostly) cotton, super comfortable and not give me any sort of muffin top whatsoever.  These guys hit all of my underwear requirements right on the head!  I have been searching for the perfect thongs for a while now and I feel like my search is over with these.  I was wearing the cotton thongs with lace waist prior and although they are great at not marking under clothes, the lace falls apart way too fast in the wash and I don\\'t find them to be nearly as comfortable as these.  I will also mention that I have only washed these once so far so I cannot comment on the longevity just yet but I think they\\'ll hold up way better than the lace ones.A few things:1. Two were repeats.  I don\\'t care about this and neither does the hubs.2. They do have tags on the back and I wish they didn\\'t.  The tags have to be cut off as opposed to being able to remove them completely by un-sewing them.  This is the only negative for me.3. Some are softer than others but they\\'re all still very comfortable.4. The cotton crotch lining piece is bigger than in any of my other thongs which I really like.  It comes up higher in the front.5. They are snug and stay perfectly in place without creating any tightness in the waist.  I practically don\\'t even feel them.6. They come in patterns which makes them cuter than the all plain colored ones usually available in cotton.I hope this review helps someone else since I know how difficult it can be to find perfect underwear.  I love these so much I am about to order my second pack because I\\'m worried they\\'ll either stop selling them or they\\'ll alter how they\\'re made somehow.Update 8/9/18 - attaching a picture of packs two and three I just received.  They came in the exact same patterns as the first pack and the two repeats are also the same (plain beige and purple pattern).  I will note the price went up a bit - I paid $19.86 for the first pack and $21.17 for the other two packs.  I love these so much I don\\'t want to wear any of my other underwear anymore.  Also, I have now washed and dried the first pack a few times and they still look brand new.In stores, I usually buy a size 6, which is a Medium/Large... My hips measure around 39\", so I ordered the Large just to be safe, and they fit very well:  no muffin top at all, but not too baggy.  They are really good quality for the price... I have bought other cheap packs of thongs on Amazon which fall apart quickly.  But these look very well stitched, and the cotton is not too thin.  I received a few duplicate patterns, but that doesn\\'t bother me, since I still have about 9 different patterns to choose from out of 12.  Can\\'t complain.Update:  after several months of wearing and washing, these thongs have proven themselves extremely comfortable and durable.  They wash very well and hold up well:  No color fading, stitching failure, or fuzz bumps.  I\\'m now buying a second pack and replacing ALL of my inferior underwear with these thongs.  Very glad I found these!These fit well and are nice quality especially for the price... However, the description states that there would be no duplicates and that they are tagless for comfort with the size printed on the back waistband. I received at least two sets of duplicate colors/prints, and each and every pair had a tag in the back waistband that I had to cut out as it would have been very scratchy. For the price however they can\\'t be beat- they\\'re not the cute prints shown in the photo description either, but they\\'re not terrible ugly either! They do fit great and they are very soft and definitely well made for the price.Thongs are such a tricky thing for me. Most of them are so poorly made, it\\'s frustrating to find anything.I\\'m 5\\'6 and 127lbs and the small fit me perfectly. I could probably be a few pounds heavier and they\\'d still fit and a few pounds smaller and they\\'d fit even then.1) perfect fit (use the size chart and measure yourself... going by typical sizes probably won\\'t help you)2) adorable cute patterns3) not too juvenile4) so comfortable5) cotton cotton cotton6) feel high quality7) price is phenomenal!!Can I say enough good things? Buy these and see for yourself :)Very cute, the reviews about duplicates is definitely accurate. I don’t care about the duplicates but I’m sad I didn’t get the Poka dot ones, that’s the pair I wanted the most!Highly annoyed that you almost cannot find a thong in a store anymore. Seems like when I do find them, they\\'re all really short. Like, they sit half way up your butt cheeks instead of your waist. These are great! I don\\'t have that problem with these.This is a great bundle pack of underwear! They\\'re not for a sexy date night but at the same time they\\'re cute enough that I would have no problems with a date seeing me in these. They\\'re really comfortable but I wouldn\\'t say they are completely no show as the cotton band that goes around your hips is wide and tends to roll up when you sit down (or at least on me). Maybe if I went a size down this wouldn\\'t happen as it\\'d be a little tighter around the hip but again not really an issue under most clothes.Yes you get duplicates in the pack but I\\'m pretty sure these are just in a huge bin and 12 are counted out at random. Again, to me, this is really no big deal. I mean come on you\\'re wearing them under your clothes and for the money I don\\'t really think anyone has room to complain about this.These also hold up very well when run through the washer AND dryer!! I usually air dry thongs but, living in a studio, my place started to look absolutely insane on laundry day with clothes drying everywhere. So lazy me just tosses these in the dryer and if there is any shrinkage its very minimal. I\\'ve only had 1 pair tear at the side seams but that was actually due to the washing machine and me rushing while pulling the clothes out.I\\'ve purchased this pack twice now and as long as the price stays similar, I will continue to when needed.I debated between the cotton and poly seamless ones and everyone raves about the cotton and says the seamless ones are terrible. The cotton don’t run big like the reviewers said and they don’t shrink or hug nicely even after washing. I wish I trusted my gut and got the seamless non cotton pack instead.First of all I wear size 5 or small in women panties. There is no stretch to material as described. It\\'s shame that I will not be able to wear them. I love the colors and softness of material. I don\\'t like that there is a tag on the sides (not comfortable). The waist band has thick seams all the way around. Seams can be seen through tight leggings.Good fit and very soft. No elastic at all so they are just like tshirts. Once you wear them for a bit, they fall down. One of the benefits of thong panties is that you dont have to mess with them. You have to pull these up a dozen times a day.Although they\\'re not completely cotton, they\\'re very soft on your skin. They make it feel like you\\'re not wearing any underwear but also provide the support you need when you\\'re wearing them.The best underwear I’ve ever purchased! So comfortable...great material...invisible under clothes. I’m ordering more!Undoubtedly the softest thongs. Perfect placement to cover abdomino plasty incision line. Very comfortable. Maybe size up, though.These are just perfect- soft, comfy, cut to the right shape. Very pleased!Soft material and doesn\\'t ride up so I lived themAfter reading the reviews, although I am a size 10, I ordered 2 packages at a size Ex-Large. I tried on one pair over the fresh cotton underwear I was currently wearing in case my order needed to be returned. I wanted to make sure I did not have those dreaded panty lines! The pair I tried on fit. I then used that pair to measure the others. Only one color did not meet the same size....the gray pair in each package ordered.As far as the reviews that complaint about the quality...get real! These are inexpensive!  I am a fan of Victoria\\'s Secret and I purchase the same type of  panties on sale for 2 pair for $25! Of course they are better quality. I save them for my special someone. I am smart enough not use them to compare the quality of bargain panties!You just have to remember: order larger than you wear, wash on the delicate cycle, wash separate from other clothes ( my reason for buying 2 packages ) and do NOT dry.....and certainly do not \"tug\" them up...that simply means you need a larger size. I have been a 2X and I know it can be awful but it is what it is.As for the gray pair...it is what it is.They actually fit my fat ass lolI bought these as a Christmas gift for my fiance and she really likes them.  A lot of her older lace underwear (mostly from VS and Target) had fallen apart, I guess from too much heavy washing, and she wanted more to replace them.  These were at a good price and looked similar to what she had before, maybe a bit more see-through than the old ones (I\\'m not complaining) and they seem to fit just fine.  This 5-pack was $16 I believe, and if we had replaced them at Target they sell those for 5 for $20, and VC would be probably $30 for 5 so buying this saved money for essentially the same product.  I guess we\\'ll see how long they last from here though.5’4, 120 I ordered the small and they fit perfectly. Great for going to bed with a t shirt and underwear without wearing a thong, and still looking cute. Will buy againLove these! For reference, I have 35.5\" hips and got the XS. They fit beautifully and don\\'t itch like some lace. I should probably size up to S on next purchase but the XS fit great and I love how they look on me.Ok these are cute and fit nice (some colors are tighter than others) but really the problem is the cotton lining. I\\'m going to get a little personal for a second. Never have I ever in my life had a problem with cotton lining placement, so I\\'m assuming my \"alignment\" is normal. This cotton lining covers ZERO of my front bits (you know, the parts you want lined), only covering my back side. The lining is about 2\" in length. Maybe I am just weirdly aligned after all, just don\\'t expect much protection from these.The reviews were right! These are really nice and soft and stretchy, not uncomfortable like a lot of lace panties. Perfect amount of cheekiness without riding up. I normally wear a 6-8 in pants/8 skirts/overall medium size, but I did order a large in these underwear because I like a smooth fit that is comfortable and not too tight or snug.Just in case you are curious --- the large fits me OK on a 38\" waist. some major readjusting necessary. Look (according to wife) and feel great!Cute but only for girls with a or b cups 😒these fit as expected.  I should have gone with a medium though. I\\'m not as small as I thought! lol that was my fault...not the manufacturer. my boyfriend loves themThese underwear are a nice design and that is it.The style is more like a cheeky than boy short, there are no indication for what is front/back.PLEASE size up if you have booty. These are not all day underwear...they do ride.My measurements: 5\\'3,180 pounds,32 waist and 41-42 hip and purchased a Large.They look great but the material is very flimsy. We put these to through the wash and the lacing got all frayed. I\\'ll have to wash these in a delicates bag next time, but never really had to worry about that with my other lacy higher end VS panties. I guess the only purpose I foresee these is for foreplay/ roleplay as throw-away panties with the sole purpose of having them literally ripped-off.I ended up loving these more than expected. I\\'m 110lbs, 5 feet and I got the small. They fit exactly like the picture and actually make my butt look amazing. I only buy cotton panties and it\\'s nice to finally find some that are both sexy and comfortable.Very uncomfortable!!! Would not recommend it to my worse enemy... They look cute but not worth the pain....These are of very poor quality and the picture alludes to them being more form fitting than they are.  They seem like they were just cranked out without any thought given to fit or quality.I ordered up a size (I ordered small instead of xs) and they fit fine. They could have been a tad bigger, but they\\'re quite comfy. I washed them in a garment bag and they survived the wash. I wanted to wear one this morning, but there was a large hole in the side. I haven\\'t inspected the others yet. The ones I\\'ve worn had no problem. Hopefully it\\'s just one that has a hole.Don’t get me wrong, these panties are super cute. I love the variety of colors. But the cotton part that covers, or is supposed to cover, you between the legs is so small. I stopped really wearing them because with jeans it hurts pretty bad. Which sucks because I love how they look.This product fit as it should. These panties take a minute to get used to but if you like a little rubbing activity these are for you. My husband said they were amazing. I highly recommend if you want to try something to spice things up they are not to over the top but just right paired with a short skirt and a corset. I do think if you had a lot of hair it would not be so pleasant but I don\\'t know?These are exactly as you would expect.  Quality is fair for the price, they are finished well but the fabric is very cheap.  Pearls on the string and purple pair are PERFECTLY placed, the black pair are gorgeous but not as \\'functional\\' if you catch my drift.  Overall, very enjoyable for a change of pace.  (Pro tip: leave a pair in your partner\\'s pocket to find later... then wear them :)I ordered one size up and they all fit comfortably. I\\'m so grateful that this seller carries more than just the standard \\'one size\\' that generally doesn\\'t fit anyone over a size medium!One pair was damaged in shipping, but Amazon took care of it.Husband approved! Black ones don’t fit properly (pearls don’t sit where they should), purple ones are great - everything goes where they should (& feels wonderful). The 3rd pair also fits well and feels great- however, not for all day wear. Overall, not afraid these will break, minimal pinching and definitely loved by me and my husband.They all fit as expected. Even though there have been mixed reviews about sizing. The leopard ones are squeeze into my hip fat so I felt awkward in them but they turned out to be my husband\\'s favorite. (Guess he wasn\\'t looking at the rolls)My wife loved wearing it. Took a bit for her to get used to it but she would give it 5 stars. She enjoyed the variety with the different parts and pieces. I dropped a star because it wasn\\'t the highest quality workmanship and the pearls seemed cheap but the fit was good and it definitely added spice to life.The purple one has three large pearls. This one is the most comfortable fit. It doesn\\'t pull hairs like the other two. The two with smaller and longer strands of pearls both pulled hairs. It was a mild discomfort to me and could be tolerated for short bits of time.Bought these to surprise my wife and they fit her perfectly -- I used her body measurements and compared with the sizing chart.  The pearls on both sit right where you want them to and she loved the added pleasure.  As other reviewers have stated, you should probably both shave to avoid any pulling ;)I really wanted to love these. I had been looking for a cotton pantie w/lace at the waist and legs as they are more comfortable and don\\'t squeeze. I admit that I am a very chubby girl and therefore ordered the x-large size. When they first arrived I tried them on and they actually fit very nicely maybe even a little on the big side... except the crotch was weirdly huge, it didn\\'t sag but the placement of the seams and lining just seemed OVERLY generous. Not sure if it is like that on all sizes or just graded big for the XL. But a woman\\'s privates don\\'t get fatter just because her waist does! The back seam came 1/2 way up my back-side. And now that I re-look at the photos of the item you can see that seam in the back-view photo. It\\'s actually an odd placement though which made them a little uncomfortable and kinda chaffed my tooshy. I had decided to keep them anyway and thought they would be fine to sleep in. So I threw them in the laundry. Well they shrunk... A LOT! Easily shrank 2 sizes! I can\\'t even get them on now. Super sad. Hopefully amazon will accept the return even though I washed them.The fit is great! True high waist that doesn\\'t roll under my belly. 5\\'6\", 240 lbs, and the XL is perfect. They\\'re soft, sexy, and comfortable!These are sturdy and full-coverage, but I really find them comfortable!  Smooth and pretty, very stretchy, ample crotch and high rise mean very good fit.  No extra bulges because the elastic rides at the waist.  I am a middle-aged lady with some extra padding and appreciate the slight compression these underpants provide.I was leery to make this purchase. I\\'m very happy with this purchase. They are soft and comfortable and they are sexy too! I was worried about the lace around the leg area but to my surprise it wasn\\'t snug at all. Overall they are great. Ladies if you ware a size 16W or 14W they will fit perfect.Normally I buy a size 7 in panties so I\\'m glad I purchased the XL. I\\'m planning to purchase more! Hope this review helps you ladies.Bought these because I\\'m in my first trimester if pregnancy and noticed the baby bloat already has my underwear rolling down, but not quite ready for maternity underwear yet.  These are comfortable, soft, pretty, do not roll, or ride up in the back. Definitely fit the bill of what I was looking for!Size wize, they fit perfectly! I normally wear a 16 or XL and ordered an XL and they are totally perfect! I recommend ordering your normal size.My only critique... they are kinda \"grandma panty\"-ish. They are really high waisted and full coverage. The lace does a little to dress them up and the colors are nice. Not even considering returning them, but I don\\'t think \"sexy\" is an accurate description.All in all, I like these! I\\'ll probably pick up a few more pairs before committing to maternity underwear.First off, if I hadn\\'t already washed these and tossed the package they\\'d be going back. The lace ripped as I was putting them on. I was surprised at how small they were seeing as how I sized up on them. The band was lower than I expected and they rolled down. The model had to be wearing a pair sized up 2 or even 3 times. Not nearly as stretchy as they make it look.Comfortable, sizing is correct.  A bit higher waisted than I wanted (look like granny panties) BUT they will work well under tight fitting dresses where you want no panty lines as the lace is invisible.  A bit low on the thigh too... could have been higher, but I will wear them.  Great value for $.Very soft and comfortable! I purchased the XL, but seems too high on the waist. it shorted a little after washing.This is a good set. I’m always looking for a bargain for cheap lingerie so the price was good on this. The top is a bit more full coverage than I could tell from photos (I’m a 34ddd so it shouldn’t be full Coverage on me typically). Very soft material and comfortable to wear. Overall a good set and I am keeping itThis is a great product. Nice material, looks just like photo. Looks okay on me. I would get the size you actually are. I sized up and the top doesn’t look quite like it’s supposed to because it’s larger on me. Overall it’s very nice and husband approvedI think this is a really nice, cute babydoll. What I wish is that I hadn\\'t paid attention to the reviews that say it runs extremely small. It doesn\\'t. I\\'m not skinny - 5\\'8-1/2\", 155 pounds. I ordered an XL because so many reviews said it was tiny. It doesn\\'t run small, and an XL is too big. I\\'m guessing those who said it was too small are referring to the bust. I\\'m a 36B, so the XL is much too big in the chest area. I\\'ve since bought Mediums of similar items in this brand, and they\\'ve fit perfectly. It would be nice if those who say this is \"way too small\" would mention their actual height, weight and bra size, so we can get a good idea of what size will fit.I bought this for a friend for her Bachelorette party. It\\'s a beautiful set. The top is very flowy and stretchy, so the size was great. The matching thong looked a bit small, but it also was stretchy, so hopefully it worked for her. Either way she loved it!One of the sexiest piece I have! I got it in black and I absolutely love the cute pink bows on the side slit. It is so comfortable,and I\\'m gonna enjoying showing this one off to my bae ;)Love Avidlove lingerie!Absolutely love this nightie. Is comfortable, light and durable all at the same time. Very flattering on a fluffy figure as well. Its not scratchy around the neck either which you find a lot with the halter type lingerie.Very pretty but I couldn\\'t wear this item. Just runs too small for me and I\\'m 5\\'6\" and 180 pounds.This was very flattering and made me feel sexy. I love how the girls fit in this. If you\\'re blessed with a fuller chest this might not work for you.  I\\'m a 40 c and it fit great.These pieces were very soft and not scratchy like lace normally is. I bought a Large and the set fit great. The bra doesn\\'t offer much support, but bralettes arent meant to do that anyway. Overall I really like this set, it\\'s elegant and cute and comfortable all at the same time.Sexy piece also very comfortable! Looks really good, good material and fit as expected, might order more colors, definitely recommendI was a bit worried this lingerie wouldn’t fit me right but when I put it on it fit perfectly. Definitely wearing this next week for my birthday evening with my husband afterwards. The color is absolutely gorgeous too and it looks very pretty on.I’m always hesitant on buying two piece items. The bottoms almost NEVER fit properly. If they do then the top doesn’t. Was not that case with this item and it’s made of pretty sturdy material where most lace is nice, it can tend to be flimsy. NOT THIs! Totally worth the money!So I am 5’4 and 199, I got a large and it was about as perfect as can!! It looks like nice expensive lingerie and it wasn’t expensive at all! Recommend 100%Very nice and it looked just like online. Very pleased. Great value!This fits very true to size. I like the support of the top. I wear size 5-7 jeans with a 36dd and bought a medium it fit just right. It didn\\'t make me itchy eitherVery nice!  My husband loves it.  I think I need to purchase some more.  The material is lace but  it\\'s so soft.  Sometime lace is rough but not with this set.  I\\'d definitely recommend!Size small is perfect for 34B. It’s sexy and comfortable and will look great with anything that is backless or low cut. The set is super sexy and more supportive than I expected.Fits well and looks sexy! Keep in mind you can see through the lace but I expected that. Also bought in black!This description makes this sound much more risque than it actually is. It\\'s really just a normal lace thong style bottom. The thick waist band is always a plus to avoid digging into your side. As for the top, it\\'s bralette style with a racerback, strappy back. So it doesn\\'t give support like a normal bra but is still cute and comfortable.Love the way this set feel, it is silky soft. Flattering back straps , I just love this outfit.I ordered a M I have a D breast and wear size small. I was hesitant to get a small because the breast usually don\\'t fit when it comes to sets. The breast fit great and my bottoms are big as I expected since I was going a size up.  I could have gotten a small after all! In fact This material is very streachy. The top isn\\'t cup fitting so it would fit very nicely on small or large breast. I suggest ordering the size you would like the underwear and I\\'m sure the top will fit great regardless of size !Gorgeous material, great color (I ordered red and it looked just like the picture) and the fit was great. Ladies remember to.order your lingerie a little larger than you think! I\\'m a size XS/S usually but with this set, I ordered a medium because the bra isn\\'t cupped. This is easily THE MOST flattering lingerie I own and I would recommend it to anyone, just make sure you go a size UP for this and every lingerie you buy. Trust me girls.This bra set is so comfortable!  After wearing an underwire bra all the time, I thought I\\'d give this a try.  I am very pleased with the design.  It is flattering and very sexy, and I am no skinny supermodel.  The top lace of the thong sits along my waist and covers my C-section scar and disguises my not so flat stomach.  The many straps on the back give enough support so that there is not one single strap on my back that rises up due to my breasts pulling down on the front of the bra.  I don\\'t have to constantly pull down the back of the bra.This is an adorable set. I don\\'t usually review clothes, but since I relied on other reviews to get the sizing right, I should add my own. I am 5\\'2 125lbs, 34DD and ordered a large and its perfect. The lace is soft and stretchy and though I don\\'t noramally wear thongs, these are pretty comfortable. My husband loves it of course, but the bra is also great for open back tanks and dresses! I washed this in a bra bag on gentle and it came out just like new.This set is nice for the price point. The material was smooth and soft to the touch. There was a slight manufacturing  smell when I first opened the bag, which happens more often then not with lingerie. I gave it a hand wash and it was great. I am a bigger chested woman DD and ordered a size large. The bra fit was a tiny bit small but is to be expected with my chest size. The Panties fit great and I was able to sleep in this set.They are awesome and fit great!I love these! They shipped quickly and were VERY high quality for the price. The lace is soft and stretchy, not scratchy at all, and the large fit me perfectly - I am 5’4, 150 lbs, and have 41 inch hips. Very flattering! Would definitely buy again from this company.These are cute and made of pretty good material, but cause a wicked front wedgie due to having a seam right down the middle. It\\'s bad enough to stop wearing them, eek.Cute sexy and fit great. I am between a 12 and a 14 pant.I am 5\\'5\" and about 210, and I ordered these underwear in a size XL. I am always very hesitant to order clothing online, especially lengerie or underwear, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised. They fit perfectly and are some of the most comfortable underwear I\\'ve ever had (and p.s. they make my kinda-smallish butt look amazing). I ordered a size up from what I normally would per the other comments I\\'ve read. I would even venture that someone twenty pounds or so heavier than me would also be perfectly fine in an XL (they\\'re super stretchy). Hope this helps anyone who was hesitant to buy!If you are thinking about buying these, go for it, the back view is especially flattering and sexy. For reference I am 5\\'4\" and 140-145lbs. I wear size 8 pants. I bought these in Large because I didn\\'t want them tight and digging in my butt uncomfortably. The large fits well, given the stretchiness the medium probably would have been fine also.I don’t usually write reviews but these deserve a 5 out of 5. They are soft and comfortable, you can barely feel them, but they are also sexy. I can wear them with any type of bottoms (leggings, jeans, skirt, etc). I will definitely purchase more!I been away from home for a couple of months! My wife and I want to have a special night before seen our kids.I went ahead n got her something sexy . Let me tell you. You will not be disappointed. Perfect fit.  Material is nice n soft and thick. She looked amazing wearing them. To all the husband don’t  hesitate to purchase them!!!!I was disappointed to find out that these are NOT Ninja masks at all. They are however ladies underwear. So after trying to make them fit my face as a mask I gave them to my wife. She says they fit well and are nice because they are cotton and not the lacy kind.I work out a lot and it gets so annoying wearing regular laser cut panties that get stuck in areas they shouldn\\'t.  I bought these last week to wear specifically to wear to exercise, and they are great!  The cotton is very breathable and I no longer have to worry about wedgies.  The only thing I have to complain about is that they\\'re a tad on the small side, but not small enough that I can\\'t wear.  If you order these, you may want to go up a size just to be safe.  Other than that, they serve their purpose well.Bad bad quality. After 4/5 washes is came loose by the seams etc. ALL of the thongs not just one! I am so dissapointed as I paid a lot of money for them (South African Rands!)They are really comfortable and I would order more if i am assured that quality will be 100%Great product for the price and they are very very comfortable. I\\'m 5\\'3 and weigh 130 lbs, so I ordered the mediums and they fit perfectly.I purchased a pack of the solid colors and liked them so much that I ordered a pack of the striped ones. Both were size medium. I was really disappointed in the quality control as the striped ones fit like smalls. I have since thrown out one pair from each set as the seam either ripped or began unraveling. Please also note, both solids and striped did shrink a little after washing/drying. Had high hopes for these, but won’t be purchasing again. And so the search for comfy undies that aren’t overpriced, continues! For reference, I am 5’5” and 160lbs.I would not recommend this at all. They are made small. The cut is not even exact. Like on one pair, the left leg was tight but the right leg fit. Another pair fit right and the 3rd pair the back was sewed much shorter than the front. You cant wear them. They are trash and the sizes are incorrectBought these because I felt like my other thongs were too constricting, so I wanted to try cotton breathable ones. They are comfy, but noticeable under leggings and I wore one pair for maybe two hours and noticed a hole near the hip. I haven’t noticed holes on any other pairs, so maybe it happened afterwards and they’re just not sewn well, or maybe I got defective ones. But basically, you get what you pay for.These seem well made, soft fabric, and good colors. They are more like tangas than thongs - a lot more material in the back. Picture is of a large after 1 washing, dried on low.These are super cute & just as well made as any given panties. I bought them primarily for the 2 pair that were criss cross style, not so much the one with the T style string. Those two fit great, I am a size 18 (2x) with a big ol booty. The butterfly & criss cross multi bow pairs fit well, are comfy and a great find. The T with a single bow and lace \"cheek supports\" didn\\'t work for me. The lace got swallowed by my ample behind. But that\\'s ok, for the price 2 out of 3 is a great value. That last pair would certainly be fine and cute on someone with less curves. These were a great alternative to higher priced cage back panties found in stores.I usually wear a women\\'s twelve and have issues with either riding up, falling down or just binding due to rear shape.  These do none of those. Wore them all day, and were STILL comfortable AND sexy.These arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Beware, though, they run small.... even smaller than the size chart states. I usually wear a L/XL (7-8) in panties, but ordered an XXL after looking at the chart. I tried these on when they arrived and they were uncomfortably small; I\\'m returning them and will order something else from a different company that uses USA sizing. I didn\\'t wear or wash them, but the quality looks good.Comfort is the main word...  sexy and comfy in the same panty.  Unicorns!!Very cute and comfortable! So sexy! He liked them too!Nice panties, they fit as expected and are better quality than I imagined they would be.She has worn them out to dinner and walking around a mall, so wants to me tell everyone they are great. They came with many colors which she loves the variety.I wear a medium in underwear usually but the large in these were a little small. Not small enough to order an XL but slightly bigger wpuld have been nice. They are sexy but the straps get twisted very easily & they don\\'t stay in place well. I like the pair I have but probably wouldnt order again.I purchaed this for my daughter to wear on her wedding night.  She didn\\'t want white, she wanted purple which is her favorite color.  It\\'s beautiful.  I LOVE the color!  I think she and soon to be hubby wiill like it!This nightie is extremely sexy! The lace detailing on the side is very sexy. I highly recommend this nightgown.My wife loves this. Great value for the $$$$! You wont regret the purchase.The lace is stretchy, comfortable straps, fits perfectly. I’m a size 25 or 3-5 pants. Size small shirt, about 130lbs, 36D bra size, I ordered a medium.Tenía mis dudas sobre la talla, pero al medírmelo cambió todo, es muy cómodo, suave,  la talla para mi es perfecta, la calidad está muy bien, me gusto mucho!!I love this outfit! I\\'m 138 pounds, 5\\'2 and typically wear XS. I\\'m also a 30DDD and this outfit fit in all the right places! I was very impressed because it\\'s normally hard for me to find something to fit my small waist but big enough for my cup size. I ended up going with a size S and glad I did!It\\'s very sexy looking and feels greatLove this chemise so much that I’m going to order another one.The cut is very flattering. The lace part is stretchy so it’s very forgiving if you’re larger on top, it still holds it’s shape nicely and holds everything in place, not cheaply made.I’m 5’1” and around 165lbs, the large was perfectA.  Ummmm, those panties though, right?  RIGHT!  They are just as comfortable as they are cute! The little tie in the back is such a sexy added bonus.B.  I\\'m always amazed by how soft the lace is with this company.  It feels like I\\'m wearing something four times as much.C.  If you have very large breasts, the bralette may not hold them you well (I have that problem), but it covers what needs to be covered, and you just can\\'t get away from just how comfortable it feels and how comfortable I feel in it.I just wish the straps were a bit thicker.This is a sexy set to wear under a date dress as a little surprise at the end of the night. There’s no undwire. I bought a small. I’m a 34A and weigh 130 lbs...and it fits great!This two piece lingerie looksnice on only thing is this oneis more for skinny than chubbygirls lol it looks nice and prettyon but for me since im chubbyand im picky with how i look inmy stuff its not a go for me butits really pretty and cute. Thematerial is soft and nice andit looks as shown on the picture..I am 5\\'5\\'\\', 34A and usually wear size S~M underwear.I order S. It\\'s fit me. The underwear a little bit big but I can still wear.Extremely cute and sexy  i lovethe chest part it looks super sexyand unique for a surprise night foryour husband. I made a surprisenight for my husband using thisand he was amazed... the color isas shown and its made out of areally good material.. i also lovethe bow in the front and i like thati can do a bow in the back also...the hearts on the chest part makeit different and unique...Panties and bralette are cute but the only complaint I have is that in the picture, the bra lifts and pushes her boobs together. The real one doesn’t do any of that. No lifting whatsoever, so I stitched the front together a little bit to give me some cleavage but it’s lace so it’ll probably tear eventually.I\\'m a size 14 and bought an xxl. Fits perfectly!! Love it.ohhhh yes you need this in your collection. If you\\'re looking for sexy look no farther. Honestly i couldn\\'t keep my husband off me when i wore this out under a dress. If you want to drive your partner crazy- this is your best choice.I am a comfy cotton underwear kinda girl, but my boyfriend stated that he liked the \"lacy cheekie\" look while we were out shopping a couple weeks ago (what dude doesn\\'t?) and I wasn\\'t really eager to spend $9/pair from VS.  I\\'m glad I took a chance on these.  The lace is super soft so it make wearing them much more bearable than other lacy panties I\\'ve come across. The colors are accurate and my ass looks fantastic.  BF more than approves. I actually have even been wearing them on days that I\\'m not going to see him, that\\'s how comfy I think they are. I wear a 12 in women\\'s pants and I ordered an XL (generally I\\'ll wear a L from somewhere like target.. if that helps)I always have a problem with buying undies for my oversized bottom. First, it\\'s not so easy to find the plus size undies that were not designed for conservative grandmas.  Secondly, I hate getting \"the look\" from the cashier. So, buying plus size underwear online is the best thing for someone like me.I love these panies. Very comfortable, look flattering and colors are great too. Liners stay put, fabric lasted from machine wash just fine.These panties will give you the worst wedgies you have ever experienced. The Divine Comedy could not create a circle of hell more tortuous than these undies. There are fault lines shallower than the depth at which these undies submerge themselves into your nether region. I had lace so tightly wedged between my cheeks, that I could almost taste it. Each step became a seemingly interminable agony while wearing these.This most conveniently occurs when you are in a situation where removing cotton from your backside is not suitable, of course.That being side, they’re very cute. Just prepare to be split in half when you wear them.If you\\'re questioning wether or not to order these, do it! I\\'m sure all the plus size ladies out there know the struggle of trying to find lace undies that fit right and are COMFORTABLE.. ladies let me tell you I am over the moon thrilled with these & will Definetely be ordering more. I\\'m 280 lbs & 5\\'9 and usually wear a size 18/20. I ordered up to the 3XL because usually things run small off Amazon, They are perfect.Fit very well; very soft and comfortable.Stupidly, they put the tag under the bow. So don\\'t just rip it off or the bow will come off too. If you carefully rip the tag (since its paper) it will come off without damaging the bow.Finally a pair of panties purchase from Amazon that seemed good quality and fit as expected. Usually in the stores I\\'m a 1X or XL. I wear size 16 pants. With online ordering I\\'ve learned to order a size up and I ordered a 2X and these panties and they fit great and they seem like really good quality. I don\\'t think they\\'re going to slide down, like other panties did. I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re going to hold up nicely and not fall apart, like other panties did. And they do not run small like most others did. I would recommend these. Plus they look a lot better in person than they do online. They\\'re sexy and comfortable and can be worn with anything. If they end up falling apart or roll down I will update later!“Women’s plus size boy shorts” NOT!There is...ahem...nothing covering my cheekiness! And something creeping...like a wedgie...? It’s a one-sided thong! Maybe you knew?Oh well, also completely sheer which is not apparent in the visual shown here. They’re very, very pretty and lacey, however. The colors are great and they seem well-made. It’s the false advert that gets them the 1-star. I didn’t want these, I wanted boy-shorts. Period. What a pain in the (bare) a** to have to return them now. Grrrr....I love these. Here is a picture of the panties they sent( the upper pair) sold by Barbara\\'s, at 6 for 19$. For comparison, a five dollar pair of the same size undies of a different brand. As you can see, these are much shinier, smoother, and of a better quality than anything in Store. They have a great shape to them, and they don\\'t make you feel like you are squeezing into them. I forgot i was wearing them! As usual, I will edit after a wash, but so far, they feel amazing!I like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitThey\\'re beautiful, but run VERY SMALL. I usually wear large/x lg underwear, these were xlg and were so small I couldn\\'t even put them on.These are exactly what I was looking for! I purchased the size recommended on the size chart (L, when I typically buy S in stores) and they fit perfectly and a SO comfortable and stretchy. Perfect to wear under high waisted clothing or with dresses you don’t want pantie lines showing through. I read some of the reviews saying the seams weren’t stretchy and was worried, but they have lots of give. Couldn’t be happier!I think these are meant for smaller women as pictured. They don’t fit this way for me being a size 13-16.Cool as air. Lovely colors and the lace is gorgeous and not at all itchy. Washes easily. No snags or imperfections. Looks great under tight clothing, no panty lines. LOVED this product and have now ordered it in a number of colors. Probably won\\'t wear anything else going forward!I wore these for a boudoir shoot and really liked them! I haven’t worn them in my every day life yet but they were very comfortable during the shoot so I’m sure they would be comfortable then too.Looks pretty even on a man. Love it.A little on the small side but useableThe briefs run way in the small side nothing like the directions.This is a good set. I’m always looking for a bargain for cheap lingerie so the price was good on this. The top is a bit more full coverage than I could tell from photos (I’m a 34ddd so it shouldn’t be full Coverage on me typically). Very soft material and comfortable to wear. Overall a good set and I am keeping itThis is a great product. Nice material, looks just like photo. Looks okay on me. I would get the size you actually are. I sized up and the top doesn’t look quite like it’s supposed to because it’s larger on me. Overall it’s very nice and husband approvedI think this is a really nice, cute babydoll. What I wish is that I hadn\\'t paid attention to the reviews that say it runs extremely small. It doesn\\'t. I\\'m not skinny - 5\\'8-1/2\", 155 pounds. I ordered an XL because so many reviews said it was tiny. It doesn\\'t run small, and an XL is too big. I\\'m guessing those who said it was too small are referring to the bust. I\\'m a 36B, so the XL is much too big in the chest area. I\\'ve since bought Mediums of similar items in this brand, and they\\'ve fit perfectly. It would be nice if those who say this is \"way too small\" would mention their actual height, weight and bra size, so we can get a good idea of what size will fit.I bought this for a friend for her Bachelorette party. It\\'s a beautiful set. The top is very flowy and stretchy, so the size was great. The matching thong looked a bit small, but it also was stretchy, so hopefully it worked for her. Either way she loved it!One of the sexiest piece I have! I got it in black and I absolutely love the cute pink bows on the side slit. It is so comfortable,and I\\'m gonna enjoying showing this one off to my bae ;)Love Avidlove lingerie!Absolutely love this nightie. Is comfortable, light and durable all at the same time. Very flattering on a fluffy figure as well. Its not scratchy around the neck either which you find a lot with the halter type lingerie.Very pretty but I couldn\\'t wear this item. Just runs too small for me and I\\'m 5\\'6\" and 180 pounds.This was very flattering and made me feel sexy. I love how the girls fit in this. If you\\'re blessed with a fuller chest this might not work for you.  I\\'m a 40 c and it fit great.When I ordered them, I expected crouchless because that\\'s what it said. They weren\\'t. That being said they are still pretty. I will keep, but am not happy. I don\\'t ever write bad reviews unless absolutely unhappy. I gave a 3 star because panties are pretty and soft. Just not what I wanted.Super cute and sexy. Nice and soft materials. Runs large. I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you. Just didn’t work for my post partum body.First of all, thank you to the company for listing a chart with their sizes in relationship to woman\\'s jean sizes. 🙌 Because let\\'s be honest, I\\'m not going to measure myself, but especially not to buy just underwear. So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front \\'area\\'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: \"Well I didn\\'t have to take these off, which I like, so more\" (He\\'s not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉Super stretchy material. I love these. Try aren\\'t the most amazing thick quality but they will work for the price.These were so sexy and I looked hot in them. I do not wear a 3X, but because they stretch I got a larger size than what I believed I wore. It fit perfectly.I went off other reviews on how they run for size and everything I read said they run small so I ordered a size larger and they are definitely larger.  They weren\\'t too large to go through the effort of returning them but would have been sexier if the fit was better.Bought for my nieces bridal shower . I think she’s going to love them ! It’s for a pantie game they’re playingThese are exactly as pictured. The XL size is a little bit on the snug side but not bad.Supposed to be cotton - they aren’t.  Good luck getting a refund from this Chinese Company.Okay, if you have a longer torso, this will be perfect. It\\'s not as form fitting as I would like, but I am 5\\'1 and 115lbs. It\\'s a bit more delicate than the lace from somewhere like Victoria\\'s Secret or Fredericks, but a lot of bang for your buck.Love this!!! Super comfy and flattering. I have a belly and it does a good job somewhat disguising it. I am a 10/12 5\\'5\" and 170 pounds and I got a large and it fit great!nanSits high on hips just FYI! Wore high waisted jeans with them for my birthday dinner with Hubs and received a ton of compliments. Hubs loved it a ton too. Definitely see through, so wear a bra unless you want to nip and show em off. If so.. then nip and show away!Very comfortable, stylish, breathable.I loved it! The fit was true to size but it barely went around my hips cause the trim that connects with the straps is not elastic. I’m usually a size small in vs underwear and swimwear so i went for that, i’m 5’3”. It’s a really thin soft material and it looked exactly like the photo. I don’t think it will last though but for the price is good.Had to hand wash to get rid of the plastic-like smell. I wouldn’t recommend machine wash cause it’s SO delicate.I’m also gonna mention this cause a friend asked me.. this doesn’t hold anything in place if you maybe thought it did.. it’s extremely thin and it just stays on top of your body.It\\'s definitely a sexy lace teddy to wear! It looks exactly like the picture; I will say that there isn\\'t much support in the breast area, so be prepared for that. But it ran true to size. I got an XL and I\\'m 5\\'4\" 215 pounds. For the price, it\\'s definitely worth the money. Shipping was fast and overall I\\'m very pleased with it. I wear it often. Oh!! It\\'s best to hand wash as the lace is delicate.5’9” 145lbs. Size 6-7 pants, small-med- shirts, breast size 34 D. Ordered M, This cami was a little loose for me. The straps had some great stretch, and the fit in the hips was nice.  I didn’t care for the price compared to product received. Although beautifully designed with the hip flare, I feel as though this should be under $10.Loved it! Im 5\\'4 160lbs and purchased a large. The material is a little thin but still great.I love it super cute better for a longer torso it\\'s pretty loose on my stomach I\\'m 5\\'2 115 got a small usually wear size 3-5 really got here super fast!I got this because my husband has been traveling a lot for his job for most of the year and I wanted to spice things up while he was away.  I sent him a few pictures of me in this while he was at work and the outfit got the reaction I wanted ;) I am 5\\'0 119lbs and the small fit perfect.  I am a small A-cup so it\\'s just the tiniest bit loose around the chest but I just pulled the strings tighter and it was fine.  I highly recommend this product!I’m 5’2 135 pound with a 34DD breast and 26 inch waist. It’s kinda small on top . Side boobs popping out it that’s okay with me . The waist area is a little loose. Bottom fits well because it’s a g-string. The matierial is good. Not flimsy. I ordered a size small. The breast area has tie string so it can be easily adjusted to how tight you want it. Overall I do like it.I love this but it def runs small. I sized up, as I always do with amazon lingerie. And I think I am going to buy another one and size up again. So go 2 sizes up maybe. The strings around the hips are small on me because my leggings size is usually a large, and top/dress size a medium. So I need to size up for the bottom half too. And the extra length would be nice since I am 5’8”. I think an extra large will be perfect. The large is very nice tho. It digs into my crotch a little, because it’s a string and it’s pullinh because I would ideally need more length .I was on the fence about this lingerie, but my man likes me in red and I liked this shade of red. I thought the cut would be unflattering but it’s actually really nice! The ties behind the breast and neck help you get a little lift on the bust line, and the lace is soft and stretchy. I’m a 32DD (28-inch waist, 38-inch hips) and the small fits perfectly. I will say that I’m only 5’4 and have a short torso, and the length JUST fits me. Girls with longer abdomens may find it uncomfortable.I am 5’9, 130 pounds and got a small . Fits nicely , the halter and back are adjustable like a bikini top, and the lace part is stretchy- was worried Id be too tall for it but the halter holds it in placeSuper sexy outfit. My favorite that I have in my closet. Fits absolutely perfect.So sexy fits great in 5\\'2\"34b 116lbs and looks amazing.I got the pink one in small. My man loved it. And so do I..When I ordered them, I expected crouchless because that\\'s what it said. They weren\\'t. That being said they are still pretty. I will keep, but am not happy.

It’s for a pantie game they’re playingThese are exactly as pictured. The XL size is a little bit on the snug side but not bad.Just throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just don\\'t care!!  This two piece EXACTLY like the picture.  I mean, I have some extra bumps and lumps, but the lingerie is true to size and makes me look and feel incredible!  The lace is always so soft and the design is fresh, seductive and frisky!  I purchased the red, but would love this in a sea foam green or teal!  Hint, hint.  Wink, wink.I am a 14/16 after losing over 50lbs and this was my first lingere purchase. I ordered an xl because ideas worried it would run small but it is actually true to size and I wish I\\'d ordered a large! I have worn washed and tumble dryed this set with no problems! Will be purchasing more!I don’t ever leave reviews but I felt the need to leave a review for this. This is so soft. Looks exactly like the picture! Excellent quality. I would definitely recommend buying. I am excited to wear this.I ordered the size suggested by the sizing chart and it fit really well. It does fit like the product photo so the top won\\'t go much past your belly button, but its no big deal. The fabric on the top was soft with just enough stretch, and the sheer lace back is very pretty. The bottoms fit well and have an elastic waist so they\\'re easy to get into as well as soft and comfortable.I\\'m 5\\'9\", 155lbs and size 36C. I bought a large because I DEFINITELY should have bought a medium. It\\'s so so so cute though but with the top and bottom being too big, they fringe on me instead of sitting flat. Still though, short time on so I\\'ll rock it.Also, the bottom of the bra has adjustable bands.Out of four outfits from this shop I ordered, this one fits the absolute best. the bands in the back aren’t tight, they don’t show back fat, the front holds my boobs nicely and covers them. The bottoms fit well also and aren’t too tight, but make my bum look amazing. I love this. It’s pretty thin lace material all throughout though, so one wash and it’s gonna be garbage. I’ll have to hand wash it but I’m a dancer so the lace thong won’t last longer than a few nights, but this is linergie not dance wear so what do ya expect.Very nice! I like that the top os adjustable however even at it\\'s smallest it was a little roomy. I\\'m 5\\'2\" and 122lbs with 34DD bust. Bottems fit perfect. Top was a little lose but will work. Great product!I seriously doubted the sizing on this product but it was right on target! Typically, apparel made in Asian markets doesn\\'t fit my generous American body but this was not only true to size, it highlighted my best attributes! The material lays wonderfully over my curves, it\\'s obviously stitched with care and quality in mind. Also, the price was great. I only wish shipping didn\\'t take so long - I missed an opportunity to do boudoir photos in my new sexy lingerie! Obviously, that\\'s not on the seller. I just like these so much, I\\'m disappointed I don\\'t get to immortalized my goodies in pictures. :)Perfect fit looks greatI am 5\\'9 and 149lbs and I got a medium.Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this lingerie.  The fabric is nice, it fits how it should, and really follows the curves of a womans body.  SUPER happy with this purchase. I will be buying more from avidlove!I love this lingerie set! I am 5\\'6, 145lbs, and ordered a medium. It fit nicely.This item is very flattering and I believe that it would look good on just about anyone. If you have a bit of a belly and/or love handles, it hides them nicely. It\\'s flowy and the materials are nice. I felt very comfortable in this.Very pleased with my purchase!Cannot love this any more than I do. Very well made. Super soft material, and incredibly flattering on. I am an A cup (5’5” 130 lbs) and usually have a hard time with lingerie, but I got a medium and it fits perfectly. The lace is super soft and stretchy so it should fit many bust sizes. The g-string it comes with fits surprisingly well which I was not expecting. Overall a great buy and would recommend it wholeheartedly.No complaints! It’s one of my favorites now! I am 5.0 feet and 125 pounds 34D. It’s beautiful soft material and fits well on the body. The panty is also good and fits well on the body which is sometimes a problem but not the case with this piece! Very happy thank you!I actually really like this.  I was afraid I would hate it like most lingerie.  I\\'m 5\\'6 and 188lbs.  I have a  hanging c section belly and my boobs are typical mom boobs.  My body is not ideal, and I LOVE that even though this material is see through it didn\\'t show my body.. I guess I don\\'t really know how that makes sense but it does once you see it in person.I bought an XL, fits great.  The material is really nice, very light.  I like it.  The only downfall is the model has great boobs and is wearing one of those strapless sticky silicone push up bras.  Which I bought specifically for this, because without it- no one with boobs like me is going to natrually have that nice cleavage. But regardless, even with my small boobs I still like this.  The thong seems a a bit tight, but I\\'m still gonna wear it.The dress is very elegant and comfortable! I\\'m 5\\'7 and 170 lb with 36Bs. I ordered the large and it looks wonderful. The dress probably could have been a tad bit tighter, mainly in the chest area, but over all I am happy with my purchase. 😊❤Great for anyone who carries a little bit of extra weight and/or has wide hips like myself.So omggggggg, I love this it’s extremely sexy and flattering. It’s soft and so comfortable, I bought it for valentines day and I must say I am not disappointed!!! I would definitely buy it again maybe every colorProduct is a little big and doesnt look like picture on top halfA while ago I decided that I didn\\'t want to wear ugly underwear anymore. You know, those basic cotton ones with the waistbands that are way too tight? Yeah, I feel hideous in those. Like really ugly. So I ordered these lacy ones. I just got them in the mail and tried them on. Oh.Em.Gee. I LOVE them SO much. I ordered a size larger than normal because some of the reviews said that there run a bit small (I\\'m a small so I ordered a medium) and they\\'re perfect! They feel like nothing. I feel naked, in a GOOD way. They\\'re so stretchy but still have good structure and quality to them and they feel so comfortable. I feel beautiful. I can\\'t believe that this whole time I thought I was ugly but it was just my ugly underwear. I truly believe now that everyone is beautiful and what you wear makes a difference and you should wear what makes you feel good about yourself. I\\'m never wearing pants when I\\'m alone in my house again. I might even order some more colors. 10/10Honestly ordered these hoping they wouldn\\'t roll down on me. Plesantly surprised on all aspects of these underwear! I ordered a size up based on other reviews that fit well (2XL instead of XL). I am a US pantie size 8 and US pant 14 (hips 45\"). Upon examination of all seams the underwear is well contructed. There are no seams that extend over the fabric or don\\'t extend the complete length of the fabric requiring a seam. The top of the underwear has an elastic waist around the whole top that sewn into the two layers of nylon. The front is a low rise hipster and features a full size (one sideed) cotton crotch. To top it all off, these underwear is super comfy. Personally, I find the lace and nylon to be really soft. Will be buying more!Note: if you want spandex lace underwear to last, do NOT place it in the dryer. It will destroy the spandex prematurely since it is heat sensitive.Great underwear! At Victoria Secret I usually get a size M but decided to play it safe and get these in a Large. Definitely not a bad idea to order one size up because it’s a good thing I did! Awesome quality. I wore each pair about 3-4 times already  and none seem to be coming loose. I noticed some cheaper underwear will slowly detach where the lace is sewn in, but these are holding up great. Would recommend!I received my order today and I have to say I am very happy with the underwear. They fit just perfect. I ordered a size Large, I measured my waist before placing my order and they are 41 inches and the size Large fits perfect. 5 stars!I hate undies. I haven\\'t bought any in years. I was bugged gently into buying something sexy that I would actually wear. So I looked. And I read reviews. And looked more and read more reviews. I settled on these ones. I love them. It feels like I\\'m wearing nothing which is what I like. But with these and a tee shirt on I know I\\'m not the only one who\\'s happy. I wash them the right way so the last hopefully. I\\'d buy more. I\\'m not much for recommending undies but if you need some these are really nice. Oh...side note...I have a really small butt and non existent hips. I ordered according to the size chart and they fit perfect. They do kinda dip down low in the front but that\\'s something I think can be adjusted occasionally and it\\'s a matter of preference where they sit.I\\'m 5\\'4 140 lbs with a big booty and sizable hips...and I ordered a size medium. They fit okay, I\\'m working on losing weight this month lol but if turn out pregnant that\\'d mean these chonies will not fit! The middle seam also won\\'t center without giving me a wedgie. THat being said they are super comfy compared to my regular hanes undies...the band is not tight or constricting. If I was at my usual weight even without the exercise, soft mama body, these would fit perfect. I think at the moment my hips will suffer with an indentation even without the extreme waistband constriction. So bottom line use my body for reference and compare with other reviews that provide their weight and body shape, such a helpful reference! I did receive all the undies in my order and the colors are true to the photo.The product info, Q&A\\'s, and reviews were all helpful. I\\'d say these fit as expected. I usually wear a large, purchased a large, and they fit comfortably (5\\'3\", 170 lbs). I love how light they feel. They are smooth and the lace is not irritating or stiff. I forget I have anything on!These are cute and but run on the small side. I got size XL and they barely manage to cover me up. Granted my boyfriend likes them and says they look good on me. The quality is good and the lace is awesome. Recommended if you\\'re comfortable with small lingerie.I\\'m ALWAYS a size medium on panties..these are WAY too small..I think an XL...wasted my money because I\\'m too lazy to send back...one star because they do look exactly like pic..and are very pretty...They were as expected…For the price I wasn’t expecting much BUT actually was very impressed with these lace thong panties. In all seriousness, these are basically the same as Victoria’s Secret and way cheaper. I have been a loyal VS customer for this exact type of panties but the amazon ones are a game changer for me.I ordered Medium and received 3 Medium, 2 Small and 1 with no tag at all. No one checked the package when putting this togetherLove these!! I usually buy from Victoria\\'s Secret,but their prices are always high and not such great quality. These panties were cheaper and better quality. I put them on and fell in love! So happy!! Will be buying them again soon!!I like the price/color options. Lace is very thin and can dig into sides which leaves for an unflattering look. Pretty much turns into a G-string by it folding/rolling.These run ultra big, they’re ok if you’re into hiking them up to your belly and wedgiesI’m always a size M in department store thongs & underwear and the size M was perfect and fit as expected. The quality is great too!Not great, but not terrible. Definitely not nice enough for a sexy date night, but good enough for everyday underwear when all your fav\\'s are in the laundry. Soft and comfortable enough.Sexy, open in all the right places and elegant. Can\\'t wait to surprise my BF with them. Fits nicely. Great value for the money.I am 5\\'7\" and 185lbs...38 c and hips are 44 inches. The large fit me PERFECTLY and the pink is a super beautiful hot pink ...the underwear were a little big but whatever this was still one of the best purchases ever! Its stretchy too! GET THIS!Set was great, used for my maternity shoot and was not disappointed. Did not expect top to be see through though, that’s not what’s advertised in the picVery lovely. The tie around the neck really helped hold the “girls” up and in place. Used it for a boudoir photo shoot for my fiancé. I’m fuller figured at 5’9” and 200ish lbs.I\\'m about 5\\'2, and wear a 36D bra size. I ordered the rose pink color in a size large, and it fit perfectly! It was a liiiittle small on the bust area, but not small enough that I spilled out. It has some good stretch to it, so that\\'s a plus. Perfect length as well, and accentuated my short legs nicely. It\\'s suuuper comfy and the material\\'s great as well! Boyfriend loved it.I adore this halter style babydoll nightie.  I got the babydoll lingerie in the purple color and it is a gorgeous rich color. I am just under 5’4” and currently wear a size medium or 6-8 but I am busty, 34DD, so I sometimes have to get a large or xl in tops depending on the style and fabric. Since these are Asian sizes and looking at their sizing chart I decided to go with size extra-large.  It fit a little big so I could have gone with a size large and it would have been fine.  But where the wide ribbon ties connect to the bodice and because it ties behind the neck halter style I don’t have to worry too much about it falling down.  The lace material across the bust is very stretchy and so soft with a scalloped edge. The rest of the nightie is a soft, stretchy, flowy, sheer material.  The material is a blend of 65% polyester and 35% cotton.  The ribbons are soft, satiny, and wide and look very lush.  The panties are made from the same soft lace as the bodice.  This set is very comfortable to wear and sexy and flirty and the length hit me like a mini dress.  It is very flattering.  The care is simple, I placed it in a lingerie bag and washed it on gentle cycle cold with detergent for delicates then laid it flat to dry.  It dries quickly.  It is sewn well and I have had no loose strings or fraying.  I purchased my babydoll nightie at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I was so excited when this arrived in the mail! The colors are true to the picture (I got the sea green one). Packaging is nice.The lace on top matches the panties and the the ruffles on this piece is absolutely adorable. I am really impressed with the quality for the price and am planning on ordering the same piece but in black! The panties are so cute! I have recently started ordering lingerie online and most pieces come with a little g-string or thong but this comes with a lace cheeky / boy shorts type. I would love to buy a pack of these.I unfortunately did not take any photos in it (because I was ambushed by my boyfriend when he saw me trying it on ;) ). But I do plan on taking photos in it and posting as to assist anyone trying to find the right fit. I ordered an XL and the fit is great. I kind of wish I ordered a L so that it maybe could of hugged my body better and for the front to open up a bit but am already in love with it. I am 5\\'4, 170lbs, 12-14 in jeans, and 38c.If you are debating on buying this, definitely do! As I said before, quality is great for the price. If you are trying to conceal your tummy area in a cute way, this will definetly do the trick. I would defiantly reccomend it. Treat yo self!I tried this on and loved it so much... only problem was: the panties that came with it were too tiny to pull up past my hips! I ended up returning it because I couldn\\'t justify keeping it if I couldn\\'t wear the entire set. Really sad since I loved the top so much.  The top was borderline too large for me, so there\\'s no way sizing up would work to get the panties to fit. If you\\'re bigger on top and smaller on the bottom, you will absolutely love this gorgeous lingerie set.My favorite part of this set is the bottoms. A lot of them come with g strings, which are a bit boring to me. These feel super sexy and fit just right. The top is very see through which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you like. It is made of good quality materials. The ribbon that goes around your neck is very soft and luxurious. It is not uncomfortable at all. I feel like it\\'s not the best for small chested woman, but overall I like it. I\\'m 5\\'4, 110 lbs, 32B for reference and wearing removable pads/underwear for the pictures.These are really cute and I really like them but I will be honest when I say I ordered the small and they are still somewhat big. It\\'s a pity because they are really soft and comfortable. I will definitely still keep them but just a bit of a bummer to not be a little bit more form fitting.The material feels really nice. And it\\'s very soft. However the small felt a bit large for a small and it feels a bit loose. Overall, it\\'s still good. I\\'m content with it  and so is my partnerYep- it’s panties that show all your goods from behind. Does it’s job.I was worried that they would run small like other and ordered a xxl. I wear a size 14. I\\'m 5\\'7 and 170. I could have done an xl. Great material!it was a giftAs expectedIt’s really pink not at all red. I wanted it to look more red.The item is good quality but much larger than I expected. I wear a size 10 pants and the large was way too big.I always have a hard time purchasing panties in general never mind adding the online aspect which always make things even more difficult. I wanted to make sure that these would fit comfortably and not ride up and give me wedgies all day. I decided to order a medium. I am 5\\'3\" 130lbs I usually wear a size 4 / 6 in pants and a small or medium. I am actually very surprised at how comfy these are. I usually get my panties from vs and I actually feel these are made better. The vs ones are all lace in the back and the lace rips. These are lace also however there is a sheer liner which stops and holes from being made. Happy with my purchase!I think these are beautiful to look at. The colors are rich and don\\'t fade in the wash. But they are a little pinchy at the waist and leg holes - the elastic doesn\\'t give as much as I\\'d like for it to be comfortable. The lace can itch, especially where there\\'s also elastic, but really a solid lace panty isn\\'t really a choice made for comfort! Definitely a date night staple in my house.I was a little worried to order online without seeing the fabric in person but I was NOT disappointed. Not only these are very pretty but they are also comfortable. I wear them with jeans and these do not show at all. Great alternative to wear instead of thongs. I like the fact that it has all the different colors you might need for lighter and darker pants. I will be getting a second set of these.No show underwear is one of the most important features to me when I shop for undergarments. Luckily, I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. I do like that the pack of 6 comes with different colors, which is helpful for different color outfits. They’re surprisingly comfortable (considering the lace) and look good at the same time. Not itchy and true to size.I absolutely love these panties. Inwas looking to upgrade my panties because well basically im.a mom and the last in the house for new underwear. These panties are so comfie. The material is super soft and not scratchy at all the waste has good stretch to it. They seem to hold up in the wash well I like them. The patern is super cute.I searched for days to find some really pretty lacy underwear to go with the new bras I was going to purchase (also from Amazon). So glad I found these! They came in and the colors almost matched up to the bras perfectly. The underwear is comfortable with a mesh lining so you\\'re not scratched by the lace. Super sexy with the bras!I love these underwear. They fit me so well and they don’t leave any lines! There is a cotton liner which is really appreciated. They don’t dig into my hips either. I ordered a large and typically wear a large and they fit perfectly.These underwear are super comfy! The material is sturdy and silky smooth and also holds up in the washer! The designs imprinted are very elegant. The fit is as expected and feels like I don’t have anything on at all!! Will be buying more!!It’s comfortable and real cute. The bottoms are adjustable which I love since I’m bottom heavy. The bra was a little big on me but considering I’m an A cup it’s not a surprise. I ordered a medium just to play it safe. It doesn’t run small so stay true to your size.\\xa0I love this set its sexy and affordableI bought a 2xl, i usually wear a 2xl so i went with my normal size. It was literally a perfect fit and the hight waist undies are so flattering. Highly recommend!!I loved the underwear and the feel it wasnt rough at all I guess the only thing I wish it had was the straps to be more adjustable or holter to hold the boobs up higher lol ! Im at 5\\'1 and weigh 216 and size 16 I ordered it in a 1xSuper cute and comfy. The lace is stretchy and it is exactly as pictured. Hopefully i can find more of this stretchy lace.This outfit is very cute. It has a casual, sweet and sexy vibe to it. The color is also bright and amazing like in the picture. I am 5\\'3\", 135lbs, 34b. I ordered a medium, and it fits me well. The panties on this are also cute and fit, which is surprising for me. Usually with outfits like this, the panties are awkward shaped or just strings that don\\'t fit correctly.Absolutely love it!!! I am 5\\'11 220lb and wear a size 10/12 in pants and a 38D cup and the Large fits perfect!!!I was really impressed with the softness of the material. For the price you certainly can\\'t beat it. I\\'m surprised at how well it fits.Wife likes them and the definitely look sexy. Her only complaint was the lace part could of been a bit longer. The only thing I noticed  was the back where the band comes together they over lapped the letters so the words dont look right.Es una horriblidad. Super pequeño y huele demasiado a plastico. No volveria a encarharlo nunca. Compre 2 piezas y las eche a la basura inmediatamenente. Estaban deformes ni una niña podria usarlosMuy sexySurprisingly comfortableFits perfectly! So nice!IckPretty disappointed in these. I ordered them specifically for the colors shown (black, gray, burgundy, blue, tan & white...solids) and what I got was a pack nothing like these. Seriously, it even includes one pair each of pink/purple wannabe leopard print that looks incredibly childish. Why do companies that think grown women want to wear this? Before purchase I read through trying to confirm that the colors would be as shown and I didn\\'t see anything to the contrary. They\\'ll be going back.I took a gamble on ordering these and I am so glad I did. For years I wore a traditional fit hi waist style from Jockey.  I was very disappointed to find that Jockey was no longer making that style so I have spent the past few months searching online for something comparable.  I came across these Fruit of the Loom briefs. They are made of a very similar fabric and the fit is very comfortable.  There are a few differences between the two.  These do not have a seam down the back (which doesn\\'t really matter to me).  These do seem slightly more stretchy but I consider that a pro not a con.  Be aware that a few of the colors shown online are not the same as the ones in the packages I received.  The colors are more in the pastel family than in the jewel tones as shown. This might be of importance to some if they are planning on color coordinating.  I personally will take comfort over color any day, particularly since it is for an article of clothing that I am going to wear under other clothing. I did get a black pair and a white pair as displayed. I got a bright (bubble gum) pink instead of the deep purple. I got a soft dove grey instead of the slate grey.  The blue is more like a powder blue.  The last pair is a pleasant light lavender.Fast becoming some of my favorite underwear because they\\'re inexpensive and a lot more comfortable than similarly priced non-microfiber (often cotton/polyester blends) ones.  May not be the best for you if you wear panty liners often or such products that don\\'t have wings because they don\\'t stick well.Edit: knocking off a star because I\\'ve noticed that two pairs have already come unravelled a bit where the elastic meets the rest of the fabric.  One came so unravelled that I had to throw it out.The fabric is nice, the cut is fine, HOWEVER the sizes vary wildly in the same pack. You can see in the photo the gray ones are a good 2 inches larger all the way around. They are tagged the same size but they definitely aren\\'t!These briefs are wonderful.  They fit perfectly, are silky smooth and dry very fast.  I bought them for camping and especially want them to dry overnight, which they do. According to the body measurements I wear a smaller size than I do in the all cotton Fruit of the Loom, so I ordered one size smaller and they fit just right. I wish they had come in all white, but these colors were all I could find. I have been wearing all cotton for 30 years, but these undies have convinced me to wear microfiber from now on. :-)I got Size 8. I am 5\\'1\", 169lbs, waist 28\"-30\", hips 45\". At first glance it looked like it could be too big but when I put it on, it was uber comfy. I tend to wear strictly cotton underwear and I went out on a limb with this one. It feels light and airy. Almost like I am not wearing any panties. Perfect!These are really great panties (really comfy), except one package I got had a flaw.  I have bought two packages, the second pack in late March (high-cut, size 7).  After one wash from the newest pack I noticed one pair had a hole in the seam (not a rip) where the thread had unraveled.  Not too big a problem, I thought - maybe just a one-off.  Then this morning I pulled out another pair and a large portion at the elastic had unraveled.I no longer have the packaging and I can\\'t figure out how to contact the seller.  Help!  I gave these two stars, but I hope to resolve this, because they\\'d be worth 5 stars if only they would hold together.These Fruit of the Loom microfiber briefs are very comfortable. I wear only these as they are of nice quality and stay put. I was grateful to have found them on Amazon, as I appreciate the home delivery. They are made well and tolerate machine washing time and time again without compromising their beautiful quality, feel and comfort.Size XL fit perfect if you are a size 14. Great material. Very sexy panties. Don\\'t roll anywhere. Will buy more in other colors.Pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these are. The lace wasn’t itchy, actially quite soft. The slimming fit and cut feels sexy. The unsexy part is the sizing; I ordered an XXXL based on their size chart for my U.S. size 12-14, which fit perfectly. Will buy in other colors.Purchased for my wedding day to hold in everything just for comfort. I\\'m 5\\'2 and weigh 142 and have a bigger butt and thighs. These panties aren\\'t for anybody that has a butt at all. they aren\\'t very stretchy around the butt. Weirdly enough though, they have an outlined thong sewed into them and since I paid the $16 I thought why not cut out the cheeks and make it into a thong... so they work great now and they hold in that extra pouch. A little diy but hey whatever worksThese are fantastic! Great support in a lacy, sexy package. Wore them under skirts and dresses during a trip recently and they were super comfortable but held me in all the right places! Will buy again.These would have been great if I\\'d ordered a medium. I\\'m 5\\'4, 118lbs and I\\'m usually a small in panties, but these are manufactured out of the country. The pros are that they are pretty cute and have a nice light support. Order a size up though!Fits great, I bought a 3x. I am 5\\'7\" and 200lbs. I am proportionately shaped. I was planning to get a 2x but I didn\\'t want to be disappointed if they were too small or dug into my wider hips. These fit perfectly, but I wouldn\\'t say they are shapewear style panties though. Very light control. However they do look very sexy. I am 5 weeks post partum and my husband jumped me the night I wore these. They don\\'t show any panty lines, so I will be wearing them often, but they fall more into the category of lingerie than spanx/shapewear. Still, I am pleased overall. Too expensive however so I will stick to one pair only sadly.I love the material. It\\'s incredibly breathable and stretchable in spite of the fact that it\\'s supportive wear. It\\'s also strong and durable when being washed and dried, unlike other types of lace that I have bought. It\\'s forgiving yet still supportive; I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever worn any other type of control-top underwear before that was actually effective without being constricting or ridiculously uncomfortable (I\\'d even go so far as to recommend buying these over more expensive brands like Spanx or Maiden Form).As for the complaints about having to order a size up:I ordered the XXL (my size in other brands) and XXXL (the size that was recommended) just to compare the fit. Although the fit in the XXL was tighter, I found it stretched out fine as I wore them; the XXXL fit more comfortably, but the biggest difference seemed to be in where the waistline hit me and that it didn\\'t squeeze me in as much. I preferred the size up since I have a long torso and wanted more coverage. If a customer wants more support or a tighter fit, they should probably go with the smaller size.Love the feel when it’s not to tight. Ordered two different sizes to see which worked better. I went with the one that was one size larger than I normally would have ordered. All in all it felt comfortable as a light slimming garment and it made me feel sexy... sooo that ain’t bad!I love the way this fits me!!!! It came fast and I immediately tried it on and fell in love.I\\'m a happy husband.  This item really showcases the body in all the right ways.  My wife isn\\'t afraid to wear this one, because there is nothing unappealing about.  It is definitely a hot way to spice up the bedroom.  It is see through enough that you know what\\'s there, but conceals enough to keep the imagination running wild.  We have purchased other like items, and this one really came through a winner.  Fits as expected.I am 5\\'5, 155lb, and 34c and athletic build. This fit great. This is the third product I have bought from this company and I have purchased a medium every time and have been very satisfied with all my purchases.For price, you really can\\'t beat this.  I think I should have ordered a medium rather than a small.  I\\'m never as comfortable in lingerie as I think I should be.  The top part that should cover your breasts is really small and, even though I\\'ve lost a significant amount of weight and my breasts are smaller than they have been in the past, the small top didn\\'t cover them well.  I don\\'t mean the top didn\\'t cover them well in a way that lingerie should NOT cover them.  I mean, the way the top SHOULD have covered my breasts, it didn\\'t.  Still sexy though and the boyfriend loved it too.Love this!This is my new favorite lingerie set! My boyfriend LOVES it.It fits wonderfully. I ordered a Medium and am 5\\'8\" and 143 lbs. I have a larger butt and hips, but the bottoms had the right amount of stretch, so they don\\'t cut into my sides at all or look tight. I am a 34B and the top is very flattering and the straps are not too loose. The set is surprisingly comfortable too. I wore it all day under my clothes and hardly noticed it.Very pretty. I bought the XXL, and I wear a 38 DD, and usually an XL in underwear. It fit pretty well since you can adjust the straps. If you are not reasonably happy with the perkiness of your girls, this lingerie may not be for you- it is not very supportive.I\\'m 5\\'9, 130 lb, 34B and ordered this set in a small. The top fits perfectly. The bottoms are a little more snug than I usually like, but they fit. It\\'d be nice if you could order the top and bottom in different sizes, but other than that I have no complaints!Finally found something that looks good on even a more athletic build (a cup) I love it!!No underwire. Bra was kinda big but I have small boobs so it’s to be expected. Garter was cute. Underwear slightly big but it worked out. More pics @jnaelatriceI’m 217 at 5”3 and got a XL and it’s a little big actually. But it’s very sexy ;) I really Like it.Love it fits me perfectly my bf loves itGreat stretch & fit as expected! Fit every curve perfectly! This is my 2nd purchase from avid love & I cannot wait to buy more!Really liked the product, true to size.Good quality lingerie.  Loved itI have now purchased 4 Avid Love pieces and they all fit true to form. That’s not an easy find in lingerie. Place your order true to your size and it should fit exact.This panty did fit me, and it is quite cute, I will use it, but I wouldn\\'t have minded it if was a little larger (my hips are 39\"). ! I knew I was taking a chance based on the size guide on the listing, but it came with free returns in case it hadn\\'t worked for me.  Use the measurement guide!!!!! Quality is good, condition was brand new with tags on, it\\'s very cute! The back of the panty ended at the top of my crack line, a little shorter than some other panties - but understandable based on this size.The size guide from the listing:Waist Size: 57-77cm  22.4-30 inch waist  ---- I am 26\" waist  (not needed since the panty does not reach the waist)Suitable Height: 150-170cm 59-66 inches ---- I am 68\" tallSuitable Weight: 40-60kg 88-132 pounds ---- I am 135-138 pounds.Love theseAbsolutely a waste of money. Did not fit and the material is so flimsy.Loved itExpensive for so little material. Quite frankly, I enjoy panties that cover a bit more. There are useless panties that cover more. These panties aren\\'t bad, just alright.Extremely soft fabric, Very well made. basic and classic solid colors, fit perfectly!  Cute and sexy style!! Really like these and will buy more. Still very good condition after washing in a mesh bag of a regular wash.Very nice quality. My most comfortable setOrdering more now!!Not only are these undies super comfy, they are super cute too! I love that they have the string on the side to give a sexy look, but they are comfortable enough to be your period underwear. I sleep in these, wear them under dresses, and I\\'ve even switched a lot of my thongs to these. I threw away my old undies and ordered several more of these in every color.I would be sure to wash them in a special fabric bag in the washer and dryer to keep them nice looking. Otherwise they will survive anything!These are comfy and cute but not a thong! I got a large and I usually wear a 7...... 5,4 139 poundsBased on the reviews, I ordered a medium size (I usually wear small), and they fit perfectly. I am very happy with them! Cute and comfortable. They don’t look like they will last forever, but at this price, I won’t be mad.silky, durable, and fit greatThese were exactly what I was looking for, very pretty and sexy. Good fabric , so comfortable. Great price! Want all colors they have, my boyfriend bought them for me, it was a surprise, thank you, darling!  Go 1 size up from your US size for the best fit.The panties are as soft as nylon which they are but are labelled polymide which I believe is nylon (you can look it up)either way tho these are sOOO worth every single cent. I mean you get 5 for less than $20!! The customer service is totally outrageous in a GREAT way! They email you right back with questions within like a day, even tho I emailed them just to compliment. I am not being given anything in return for this review. Just look at the pictures, it says it all. They are coming out with these exact panties in cotton. I am definately  planning on getting them if my budget allows.. I\\'m a panty addict.. PURCHASE!!! Also, they are pretty true to size. I usually wear between L/XL and I got an XL and they fit nice a tiny bit big but it makes them more comfy since you dont want them super tight, not panties like these where its meant to feel fabulous. Thongs are meant to be tight. Anyway with that being said - treat yourself!!!!Mine looks absolutely nothing like the picture, yes it came ahead of time but there is no way I would ever buy or suggest buying this. Its some halter to hold the front and a cheap clasp for the band just one. All the excess fabric is tried about a half inch from the end and it doesn\\'t have metal rings its small tiny plastic ones. Honestly its $1 store quality. Ridiculous that you can say the picture is the item I received. Only good thing was shipping said it wouldn\\'t be here til end of march and here we are mid march I\\'m not a happy customer.To be safe I ordered a Large, an extra large and a 2XL. They are all microscopic in size. They are no where near the size of the pic the seller has posted. These are total garbage and an absolute waste of time and money. VERY DISAPPOINTING!This is garbage. I tried to just open it up to put it on and it started falling apart!!!  Cost more to return it than the product itself.Since my wife is very petite, she needed to shorten the neck strap.  But it looks great on her, and she feels very pretty in it.Just like the picture! Made with great material also. Definitely a good buy.The seller did make accommodations to exchange the item for me.  I do thank the seller for being so kind about this matter.Don’t waste the time. I bought a large and an xl cheaply made and doesn’t fit at all I would have sent it back but u can’t do a return I’m big busted like the gal in the pic and it looks nothing like the pic. I will no longer buy this kinda item from amazon ever again. Don’t make the same mistake I made save ur hopes n moneySo cute and sexy. Feels great.So sexyAmazing quality, I loved it! Photographed beautifully!Super great quality and very sexy and comfortable I love wearing it just for fun.This item shipped really fast! The product came neatly packaged. It fits true to size. The ribbon is papery feeling but you can kind of tell that from the picture. Don’t plan of getting another tie bc it’s not like it’ll stay on that long anyways. Looks cute without using the ribbon too. Comfortable material, not itchy at all. It looks just like the picture. I got the white one.The lace is softer than I expected which is definite plus. The ribbon is a cheaper material which I did expect, but I didn\\'t plan on using it anyways. The thong is strings that have some give with the same soft lace up front. I\\'m 5\\'4 and 137 lbs. I bought a medium and there is plenty of room left. You honestly could use this in a day outfit and no one would know.This is a beautiful, sexy robe. I ordered a XXL for my wife who wears size 14-16, is 5\\'4\", & 40G bra. She loved it. She can cover up other lingerie (or nothing at all) underneath and still look sexy and I can\\'t complain because it\\'s basically almost see-thru. Only negatives were the removable belt that comes with it is cheap and papery & it arrived with a tiny hole (1/2 a pinky nail-sized) torn in the back.I love this so much that I own it in 4 colors! It\\'s soft, flowy, stretchy, and adds just the right amount of \"visibility\" to offer the ultimate sexy experience but with so much comfort and confidence. I\\'m 5\\'2\", a size 16/18 (210 lbs) with a small C cup, and I went with a size Large so that it wasn\\'t too baggy but was big enough to still hang over my breasts if I left it open. The material is stretchy and very forgiving. It does seem pretty durable so far. No snagging or anything. I simply love it. Yes the ribbon belt is a more stiff ribbon, but it looks fine and honestly I don\\'t really tie it closed so I just let it hang. I love this so much. Especially paired with the AvidLove sexy nightgowns. Perfection!If I could give this robe 12 stars I would.  I bought it in white, but going to buy the Black as well.  It is SOOOOOOOO sexy.  The definition of sexy.  Like, sexy looks at this robe in envy.  I love the added touch of the gentle lace fringe around the edges!!  It rounds out the overall look of this robe and gives such a luxurious appearance.  I had the collar portion a bit higher on my neck to create a longer line to my cleavage.  Just yes. SO MUCH YES!  And, matching panties included!!  Other brands just give you a cheap, scratchy robe, but not this company!I just love everything about this robe and this company!I absolutely love this! I bought it for my honeymoon. It’s so comfortable and makes me feel very sexy. I’ve been wearing it to bed and just around when we are inside during the day. Absolutely perfect.I have bought several different ones in various colors and am happy with all of them. Soft material, sexy and reasonably priced. My husband loves all of them! I highly recommend any of the chemisis from this company.Bought this for my fiancée as a Valentine’s Day gift for myself. Lol. Looked amazing on her for the 30 seconds she got to wear it. Fit perfect. Pretty sure I’m gonna be a dad now so, feel free to find more of my reviews in the baby section 😂Sizing is right on. I wear a large and ordered a large. Lace is nice and not scratchy. Delicately sweet but yet very sexy. Have been disappointed on numerous occasions previously when it comes to misleading sizes especially on lingerie but love that the sizing is true to fit on this brand.It reveals all. If that\\'s what you\\'re looking for you won\\'t be disappointed. The panties for me are just a no, no. Think it will look good with a pair of boy shorts underneath.buy one size smaller, but this is beautiful, so nice I can\\'t believe the price and it is very forgiving if your on the pump side. I\\', 4\"10 and 160 but it is very sexy, short but hides the thighs. It\\'s GORGEOUS I ordered anther one in red.I am going in a small honeymoon with my boyfriend are he loves red he also love lace this is a very good combination of both of themThe husband loves this one and so do I. I would purchase a smaller size for sure. I\\'m 5\\'9\" and 145# and a medium was too big. I purchased a small as well and it fit much better.I\\'m absolutely in love with this bra. I usually wear a 34C at VS for reference. I\\'ve always wanted a bra without padding like this, but in the past they\\'ve made my shape look a little strange. The detailing on the bra is beautiful, it feels well made, arrived quickly and totally worth the price.That being said, the panties are very small. I\\'m 5\\'8\", about 160, and the panties that came with my set were the Large. I do Medium at VS. I have hips and thighs.. These are not made for that. I can get them up, but they\\'re extremely tight on my thighs and give massive muffin top if I pull them up. I won\\'t be able to wear the panties and am super bummed about it! Not only do they give muffin top, but they\\'re overly tight and uncomfortable. I\\'d post a picture, but it\\'s too rough lolI ordered this on a whim PRIOR to reading everyone\\'s comments about the set running small. However, when the package arrived I was pleasantly surprised! I\\'m normally a 34D and the 34D size I ordered actually fit very well! It was a little tight, but after a few wears, I\\'m very confident the band will stretch to fit. The cups are a little on the smaller side, souse your judgement if you\\'re between cup sizes.The bra itself is comfortable and supportive enough (it\\'s an underwire!). Although you cannot specify the size of the panty, mines fit me very well. All in all, a very good set that is very cute.My measurements: 34D/38-27-36, 137lb.This is such a cute little set! For reference, I am 5\\'10, 155 lbs, a 32B, and wear a size 8 in pants. It is good quality and looks just like the picture.  I ordered a medium in white, and overall it fit pretty well. The top fit my boobs perfectly, the underwire is nice and not flimsy at all. I would recommend sizing up if you are heavy chested. The bottoms fit but they were a little bit tight, it doesn\\'t matter too much to me though. Overall, it is a good set and worth the money. I will definitely be ordering it in the other colors!!The lace is pretty and the color the same as shown.  Ordered 1 size up from what I would buy at VS, it was too small.  I normally wear 34C and medium panty.  Ordered a 36C and large panty.  The panty cut into hips too much. The bra was ok, just slightly snug.  I wear size 6 jeans, feel panty is cut for a less curvy person.My wife describes this set as \"Snug but comfortable.  Does not ride up.\"  She\\'s between 34C and 36D.  It looks good on her, but it does also leave marks on her skin by the end of the day, when worn from 7:00 to ~ 22:00.  We\\'d recommend this set, but also suggest going up a size on the width and the cup to ensure comfort.So I only gave this a 4 because of the panties. Would give 4.5 if I could. I\\'m 5\\'7\" and 155 lbs, athletic build. I ordered the 38C based on reviews but typically wear a 34C. The bra is PERFECT. I love the straps, so comfy. Washes well on delicate so far. The panties are a little tight (I typically wear a S or M in underwear...these are listed as XL) but still wearable all day. It\\'s a very sexy and wearable set, which is hard to find at this price point. I love the bra so much I just ordered the blue!Comes shipped in a envelope and then inside you have the baggie. Very comfort. The pantie acts more like a thong. It’s not the most stretchy band at all. So order your size when it comes to that. The bra is a hard underwire and well padded ends on the wire cup lining. The bra comes a little small in band size cup is right at B Almost C ordered a 34B this is most certainly s 32 band B cupOverall even with the bra being a tight fit it acts more of a push-up style without extra padding (a subtle boost for the breast) and I’m contemplating on getting more but ordering a band size up.The Bra and Panty are purchased as a pair. They are not well mated in size. Since you can only select bra size, be prepared that the briefs are not a standard sizing compliment.Fabric and construction were as expected.Super cute! I’m in love with it. I usually wear L but I always go a size up when I order on amazon. The XL fits perfect. I am 5’6 and 155 lbs. material is great, so soft and comfortable. I could sleep in this. I love that it’s flowy bc I feel self conscious in skin tight garments. This makes me feel effortlessly sexy. Oh I would recommend wearing a bralette with this to give your tatas a boost. There’s no padding or underwire.Love the color and style. Very Cute. But No support up top and has a plastic clasp or hook to hold it together in the front. The hook seems easily breakable. The straps are adjustable, but still doesn\\'t help with support up top. If you are heavy up top you\\'ll need a bra otherwise everything falls out. It is nice as sleep wear, which is why I purchased it. But nothing stays in place up top if you are moving around or leaning over too much. Definitely going to keep it because it is really cute. Perhaps I will try another style.Very flattering fit, loose and flowy bottom hides all imperfections.  Husband loved it.Ultimately it’s not bad... it’s really... Really soft... thong is comfy too. My only issue was that it was a little big. I’m usually a size small in everything. Small in sports bras, shirts, dresses, size 2/4 in pants. If you have a bigger bust then I’d say true to size. If you’re like me, it wouldn’t hurt to order a size smaller. Plenty of room to move. My other issue was that the button was weird and didn’t stay clipped.This is soooo lovely! I ordered a size larger than I normally wear due to reviews and it fits so beautifully!I am 5\\'4\" and weigh about 125 lbs.I just love it...no need for altering anywhere...the structure of it falls so nicely in place overallI can only complain about thing.....The clasp on the baby doll cover..is cheap/doesn\\'t work!Tried it on myself over my clothes before my Daughters Bridal Shower, and tried the clasp a few times, stopped as I was scared I would break it!Hope this helpsvelvet55Love it very sexy and very comfortable. It does run small so I would definitely go a size bigger than what you are I\\'m a medium and I got a large and it fits perfectI didn\\'t expect this babydoll to be as soft as it was, very soft and comfortable. I ordered the small and it fits my petite size better than expected. Perhaps a little lose on the sides but the shoulder straps are adjustable so that helped a lot. I plan on ordering more in a different color.Perfect! Just as I expected!Not adjustable. Very good material. Looks good and is soft.Little smallI love these so much I\\'ve bought two sets!Red set:This is such a sexy bra and panty set! The red really pops without being slutty (unless that\\'s what you want). Both the top and bottom seem pretty well made. The bottoms are super comfortable, it almost feels like not wearing anything at all. Be aware that the pics online are not quite accurate for the top, though. This is not a padded or push up bra. Unless your breasts naturally sit high and tight with great cleavage you just won\\'t get that effect with the top. Still super cute, though, and I haven\\'t had any complaints.Purple set:The bra is more of a bralette with a matching lacy thong. There is no padding and not a ton of support but it is perfect for trying to seduce my partner or wearing under a light sundress. I ordered a medium and it’s a little on the small size. I’m a 34B and it fit me my bust well but it was snug getting it over my shoulders. Once on it was very comfortable. I think women with bigger breasts would do well to order a size up. I’m very happy I have it, though!I expected the bra to fit a little better and be a little tighter than what it was, but overall this is a nice set for a relaxing evening or for something to throw on under lounge clothes.This fits just as expected and true to size. It\\'s a quality set & the panties seem even more quality than the bra does. They\\'re both beautiful and great! Very happy with this purchase!She loves it. Gave her as a suprise gift. good product. Wonderful material. Highly recommended if you are planning to gift one.The bottom looks different than pictured.  Looks good overall.  The frilly fabric is really light weight. Nice cut and color.This is a very pretty set. It’s lightweight, no padding and no underwire so it’s extremely comfortable.It’s super hard for me to find matching set that fits that sold as one size , normally , it’s XL bra and M bottoms. Im 157 lbs with 36DD and went with Size Large, the bra was a little small on me but with some adjusting, I can make it work( so it has some stretch to it ) . Lingerie is transparent on top and looks super sexy ! Material is super soft and feels comfortable.  My husband really liked the way it looks on me !So far I\\'ve ordered 5 of these shirts. I\\'ve worn and washed all 5 and feel comfortable leaving a realistic review for those of you unsure about purchasing. I ordered a 4X and the shirts fit me more like a regular tshirt than an oversized long tshirt but I am also 370lbs and top heavy. The shirts did not shrink much and I dried them on regular heat. The black did noticeably fade with one way but the others did not. From my experience I recommend washing on cold and hang drying. For the price, fit and comfort I will order these shirts regularly!!!I am 5\\'6 and 220 lbs and am a 44 DDD in the chest I am normally a 3 x and I ordered a 3x and it fits awesomely ! It\\'s soft and sexy and cute ! I will definitely be ordering more in the other colors!I purchased several shirts at the same time hoping to find some that I liked with my leggings. Must cover booty, must be somewhat flowy. I loved the cobalt blue of this one but was so unsure of what size to get. I normally wear an XL shirt, size 16. In this shirt I ordered an XXL. It fits just the way I wanted. I love the color. Out of the 5 shirts I got, this one is my favorite.Runs a little small but if you oder next size up, definitely worth it! Thesee shirts are light, thin, but very soft and comfortable. I absolutely love them! I have 4 already and ordering more! Probably every color 😉True to size and fits nicely. I usually wear a size 3X but I ordered a 4X because I wanted it to be loose. I think I could\\'ve gone with a 3X.  Matches really well with my Aztec leggings:)Love this top.Was excited to see the other reviews for this top that it actually fit true to size. I am 5’6” and wear a 22/24 (24 jeans at Lane Bryant). I ordered the 3X based on the other reviews saying it ran true to size or a little big. I wanted a shirt that covered my butt and not cling. I’m not big into leggings but have a few pair I like I wear with boots during the fall and winter. This shirt will work great for that as long as it doesn’t shrink when it’s washed. The material is soft but not too thin or see-through.The biggest problem I have with short sleeve shirts from anywhere is with my arms. They are either too tight or too short and roll up. These sleeves are a great length and very comfy. And nice for Layering over a long sleeve.  Also, the neck line is cut low but I like it that.I plan on ordering some more colors soon. The red was the perfect color and as shown.Will update the review if it changes after washingLove the materia! It\\'s not to clingy, I usually wear. Xxl and that\\'s what I ordered, 5\\'5 260 sort of large arms and it fits perfect to meHonestly, this is the least expensive, most attractive bra I’ve ever owned in my life. It feels like you’re not wearing much of anything, but absolutely gives you some lift. I don’t imagine it will last very long, but for what it is, I’m a huge fan.This review is for Vogue\\'s Secret Women\\'s Unlined Plus Size See-through Bra Sexy Lace Mesh Transparent Breathable.It should be noted that the bra and panty must be ordered separately. This is clearly said in the pictures and description but still worth saying again given they are shown in the same picture together.The item arrived with the rest of my order. The bra itself is packed in a resealable clear bag so it is visible to anyone around when you open the box.In my opinion this item is more of a special occasion bra then an everyday bra. I don\\'t think it would last long with everyday wear and washing.On to size: The recipient measures 35-1/4” band and 37-1/2” bust, so by most sizing charts she measures to a 36B.She wears a 36B in most brands including: Playtex, Maidenform, Vassarette, XOXO and so on. But sometimes a 34B will fit better, especially when a snug fit is desirable such as a non-padded bra. For example, she has a bra similar to this item made by Calvin Klein in a 34B and it fits her perfectly.The body is fairly stretchy and doesn\\'t offer much in the way of support. With a 34B she usually wears it on the largest hook, but on this bra the body is so stretchy it easily fit her on the on the smallest hook.The underwires sit where they should. It has a standard two hook rear closure and adjustable shoulder straps.Unfortunately the cups are simply too large. The 34B cups fit like a 34C with an undesirable extra fabric pooch on the top half of the cup. It should be noted the cups are stretchy and if you can fill them it looks just like in the item pictures.As far as fit goes you have to size this item for the cups. You can always add a black two hook band extender to add band size but cup fit can\\'t be adjusted. I\\'d recommend buying a cup size down, this way the cups stretch a little to fit and look good. And given the stretchy nature of the band you may want to buy a band size down also.Why four stars?The bra is as pictured and of good quality for an occasional use item. The only real issue is fit, and fit is often a problem with bras because of their complex shape. But I can only forgive fit so far. The recipient wears a 36B or 34B in almost all other bras. I bought the smaller of the two and it was still too large, so in my opinion this item does not run true to size. - Minus one star.Overall I like the item. I would buy it again if I could get a smaller size but they don\\'t offer one as of the time of this review. I would recommend it to a friend if they can get a size that fits them.***PS: I noticed under my name it says \"Size: 34C\" and this is incorrect. I ordered, received, and reviewed a 34B bra. The sizing sticker is visible in my picture.i wanted to love this bra so much, i bought the first one too small and kept it and bought one in my actual lightly lined regular bra size. i read that the fabric was cheap and thin and i since i wanted a barely there bra  i was into it. its completely see through and super sexy, you cant even feel its on its so thin but still gives a little support EXCEPT for the underwire... it stabs into my sides so much i can only stand to wear it for a couple of hours at a time. if you have any boobs at all stay away from this one. its beautiful tho.This bra is really comfortable and the fact that the material of the cups stretches to fit is so comfy I actually forgot I was wearing it the other day. When you first put it on sure you\\'ll feel the underwires but after about half an hour I didn\\'t feel them. The heart in the center is cute as well as the delicate lace trim on the cups. If the band wasn\\'t so stretchy I would have given 5 stars but even using the last set of clips I still have room to wriggle around. The shoulder straps could be shorter as well. But all in all it\\'s a very comfortable bra and I\\'ll be ordering more but in a smaller band size.**EDIT**Boy am I glad I decided to try this bra. It\\'s been in the mid to hight 90\\'s in town recently but I wasn\\'t sweating wearing this one like I would wearing thicker cup bras. Definitely need to get some more of these for next summer.**UPDATE**So after a few wearing and washing cycles the bra is now unwearable due to the band being so stretchy. After a few washes the band is too big for me, if it wasn\\'t for the underwires keeping the band under the girls I\\'m sure that it would end up under my armpits every time I stretch up to get something. I really like this bra for the summer months but the band issue is a problem. I\\'m going to buy more but in a 40\" or even a 38\" band size.Amazing! This probably the fastest review I have ever done. I bought two of these, one nude and one black. I did not read any other reviews...just a late night purchase gone right! They arrived about 10min ago. I tried one on, so I knew whether I needed to return both. And it is super comfortable! Sometimes new bra “bands” can cut into my back. And I will use an extender until the material relaxes. No need to do that with these. The material is so comfortable from the band to the straps. I am in love with these bras. Definitely a MUST have. I feel like I’m not wearing one, but still have lift and support.I first have to mention the excellent customer service. Since this bra runs very large the first one I ordered in my size of 34DDD was huge. The underwire of the cup nearly went completely under my arm and almost touching my back. I am not petite and have 500 cc\\'s in each breast and I had to re-order down to a size 34C. I contacted the seller via email and they responded promptly and politely. I did not have to return the bra that was too large and didn\\'t fit, they just sent me another at no cost.The bra itself is far from luxurious but very practical for women who are looking to keep cool on hot days or when wearing a delicate top that is not harmonious with a bulky bra.The bra does not provide much support but just enough to make you feel comfortable. If you are looking for support and a minimally structured bra this is not it.The torso strap does slightly ride up the back and this could be fixed with a smaller size but they do not carry any in a 32 measurement.I highly recommend hand washing this bra and treating it with care even when wearing it.Runs very large, size down!I dig this outfit and it’s my new money maker (dancer)! It’s classy and sexy and flattering. My only complaint is that the cups are a bit stiff maybe, it’s sort of that foam feeling but there’s a little part at the bottom where the cups come together that’s bent a little funky. I don’t think ANYONE else would ever notice it so it’s not at all a big deal, I’m just a details person. Def recommend for the priceAmazing! Love it good qualityI didn’t have high hopes, but this bra is really fantastic.  It’s sexy, and fits well. My only complaint is the hooks can come a little undone easily, but it’s not like I’m going to garden in it.  I will probably hand wash them, but I bought two and I’m very happy. They even came with an extender if they don’t fit well. I am super pleased!Not amazing quality, I liked the style of the thong it came with but it began to fall apart after a few times of wear. While the bra came with an extender both where a little smaller than expected, but not worth returning, order a size up.Yes I like it. It was actually what I expected and comfortable to wear. I like how it does have some padding and lace with it.Was a perfect fit but if it wasn\\'t shipper sent an extra extension. That\\'s planing ahead and a great service. Will order from this vender again. Remember this needs to be hand washed, if machine washed it will not last as most lingerie...While this Lace Bra Set is very pretty - its cut way to small. I am a 38B and it was so tight it hurt - returning it!really liked this but it is already falling apart near the underwire and boning on the side.Highly recommended!I finally found a bra that fits correctly! It seems to be made for my body! It’s a glorious day! The cups are literally the perfect size for my boobs (no overboob, and very little gaping when I bend over). The underwire is not un-comfortable and it doesn\\'t dig in. I wish it was a bit more lifted, but it\\'s not bad. It’s such a fun green color, and it gives my boobs a rounded natural shape and my nipples are comfortable! The fabric is nice. And my husband likes it! Would buy again!Fit perfect!!! I am so happy I got the 2 bra sets. Beautiful details and good quality materials.Looks like in the picture, very comfortable.One for me, the other for my sister.I’ll buy more of this brand.  Highly recommend:)Great price for the set! I have a very small breast size that are pointy and spread apart tremendously. With this bra I can achieve cleavage. Mine you I love my breast size ( I don\\'t have to wear a bra all the time, very convenient when exercising. However, there are some outfits that requires some cleavage ( which is something I don\\'t have naturally). This bra helps me to have some cleavage by pushing my breast together. Straps are close enough together that they don\\'t jump off my shoulders all the time. When I wear a low-cut crop top, the front straps are pretty sexy and nice. The bra is padded cups with light weight. I\\'m not scared to bend over and fall out, the workmanship looks good. It’s still comfortable after wearing it for a long period of time. Some reviews says the panties are small, I’m lucky mine is perfect fit. If too small, I’ll present it to my sister. I’m going on a trip next month, I’ll take the bra panty set with me. So excited!!WOW!!! Sexy, hot and great price. I got this set of bra and pant, I am happy with this and really love it. The pad is moderate for me. The size that I selected which is 34B fits me perfectly. I am so picky when it comes to bras with laces because I get some itching, but this set is very soft with no problem and they are comfortable. My husband loves it. I got value for my money. I recommend this set.I bought a 36C which is exactly what size I wear in other brands. I am 5\\'6\" and weigh about 150lbs and wear a size Medium 10/12 US. The bra cup size was good, but the band ran small. And the panties were even smaller. I purchased a 38C to see if that is any bigger, as that is as large as this brand goes. If you are any bigger than a size 12, you\\'re likely out of luck. I will try to update my review once the new size comes in.I am somewhat hesitant with buying bras and underwear online because I like to try them on before making a purchase. I picked my bra size and found out that it was true to size. The only thing I didn\\'t like about this set was that you couldn\\'t pick the panty size. The panties were a little snug, but still wearable. I really like how comfortable this set was. They felt great and it was lightly padded with a small underwire. The straps on the front are so cute too!First off... I\\'m 5\\'6.5...143-144lbs....4 kids, last 3 C-section .i float in between 140 & 145lbs...i usually fit a small. Sometimes medium. I\\'m a 34C to be exact. This is the 34C set.  The panties are very fitting..only because I\\'m a bit bottom heavy... The material feels very high quality and just for that I will definitely be purchasing the other colors. It\\'s very comfortable.. Fits nice and securely. Nice lift... Makes me feel really sexy.. It even comes with the extra back extender clip the same color as the bralette in case it feels too tight around your back.. I\\'m actually loving this set very much!!Absolutely LOVE this set.  Sexy and comfortable!! Everything fit true to size and quality material. Great matching set for a night out,  night at home, or a naughty surprise for your significant other,  mines said wow... Fast delivery and nice packaging.  This has become a favorite!  Buy itI have hypersensitive skin so I have to have panties that are soft to touch on my skin. These meet that criteria. They have pretty colors and feel good to. They are so soft. Will definitely buy again. Wish they had more colors.Meh. These aren\\'t bad, but they aren\\'t great. I am only 5\\'2\" and 130 pounds (this month) and I got the Large cuz I have a big booty and these felt like they had too much material in the front and not enough in back. I like cheekies, but these didn\\'t cover my entire buttcrack, which isn\\'t the part I want to show off, I dunno about you. I really wish there were women\\'s sizes that made any sense whatsoever.Very comfortable. I am 5 feet, about 120lbs and ordered a M. Fits well.On a positive note, these panties are pretty. However, all three panties have a different fit. One pair is super tight, one pair is slightly tight and the other pair fit pretty much as they should.Also has a large tag on the inside that’ll you’ll need to cut out. Otherwise the tag will stick out from underneath.The fabric isn’t the greatest. I’ve had to cut off several pieces of hanging threads.Looks exactly as pictured. Runs small. I had to return and go up a size. That always makes a woman feel good about herself. Lol.My girlfriend loves them she thought they were a great color selection I guess that matters for females lolFits good and looks good.Unfortunately these aren’t good quality . The bow in the front hangs downward. It’s cheaply made , it doesn’t hug your waist, they needed to put elastic or something to make it stay on !! And the issue isn’t that it’s too big it fits fine but it’s just cheap.One star for the soft lace, breathable and comfortable. Even the sides tie is very comfortable you won\\'t feel it and long enough. BUT the panty is really small! It could fit a teenager not a lady!I\\'m size S to M.Indeed very small, but fits me. However, if you\\'re not wearing s or xs, don\\'t buy.Tiny.... Really tiny......Not at all 1 size fits all...Liked because they can adjust after child birth and comfy and sexy!NIceArrived early.I\\'m a size 6 (30\")- tag is M, fit perfect. LOVE the patterns.They must be popular....sold out of M fast.I read others reviews stating these run a bit small. I wear a medium in Victoria\\'s Secret, so I ordered these in a large and they fit perfectly. The material is very soft and comfortable, the lace is elegant and sexy, the husband is happy. I would definitely recommend to a friend!I have not washed or worn these yet, but so far I am pleased. They are very pretty; I love the colors. The material is very soft. The price is much better than what I would pay Target or someplace similar. I am 5\\'4\" 120 lbs, and I got a medium to ensure that they did not dig at all. They fit exactly like I was hoping, just skimming my skin. Size small probably could have fit me, but it possibly could have cut into my sides, creating bulges under clothes, so I went with the medium instead. These are more of a low-rise fit instead of coming high up over the hip bone like some do. All in all, I\\'m happy!AMAZING! In love and I will most likely purchase again. I am usually a small, but after reading the reviews I got a size up and they fit perfectly. They are super cute and comfy.The bows fell off while only wearing them once, and the tags completely disentegrated after one wash. The company said I must have received a bad batch and said they would refund me, but haven’t gotten a refund yet...These thongs are so soft and comfortable it feels like you\\'re not wearing any underwear!  Very sexy!  I just hope they stand up to the wash!  They run a bit small, so I bought L as I usually buy M.  The Ls are a great fit!  On the face of it, they look a bit flimsy, so I hope they stand up to washing!These are incredibly soft! They looked tiny but actually fit perfectly! They don’t ride, they’re extremely comfortable and a great priceThey run just a little bit small.  I usually wear a small, so I ordered a medium - and even after washing/drying, they\\'re a little snug.  Not unwearable, but somewhat uncomfortable after a full day of wear.I love these underpants. Very comfy and cute. I like my underwear a little looser so I got a medium, but they have good stretch so I would recommend staying true to size. (I’m 5’4 ~125lbs. Usually wear S/M)I debated between the cotton and poly seamless ones and everyone raves about the cotton and says the seamless ones are terrible. The cotton don’t run big like the reviewers said and they don’t shrink or hug nicely even after washing. I wish I trusted my gut and got the seamless non cotton pack instead.First of all I wear size 5 or small in women panties. There is no stretch to material as described. It\\'s shame that I will not be able to wear them. I love the colors and softness of material. I don\\'t like that there is a tag on the sides (not comfortable). The waist band has thick seams all the way around. Seams can be seen through tight leggings.Good fit and very soft. No elastic at all so they are just like tshirts. Once you wear them for a bit, they fall down. One of the benefits of thong panties is that you dont have to mess with them. You have to pull these up a dozen times a day.Although they\\'re not completely cotton, they\\'re very soft on your skin. They make it feel like you\\'re not wearing any underwear but also provide the support you need when you\\'re wearing them.The best underwear I’ve ever purchased! So comfortable...great material...invisible under clothes. I’m ordering more!Undoubtedly the softest thongs. Perfect placement to cover abdomino plasty incision line. Very comfortable. Maybe size up, though.These are just perfect- soft, comfy, cut to the right shape. Very pleased!Soft material and doesn\\'t ride up so I lived themThey are very comfortable. Sometimes you want a high waisted underwear.I know I prefer that when I wear higher waisted pants or skirts, it just feels better to me. These are breathable and are soft. The colors are nice too. They fit pretty true to size for me.I’m a fan of the “cheeky” undies. These have a great design, that shows just enough cheek, but is comfortable as well. They have good stretch (a bit small, but good motivation!) and the cotton panel makes them breathable.This review is for the Multi-color 6pcs size small. These bikinis hugs low on the hips. I’m usually a x-small and small fits me, so I would recommend that you go up a size or two or follow the chart for sizing.Love the underwear very nice style. But I wish I would have ordered a size bigger. I already ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear. I guess I\\'ll just lose a couple poundsThese undies are sooo cute!! They did come a little small for a size smal (BUT NOT TOO SMALL) just fit a little snug - no muffin top or anything. I love the see through lace 😏😏😏😏These are truly sexy and very comfortable! Arrived packaged well, each underwear is individually packed which I like very much. Seems very durable and nice material!These panties are pretty and fit as described. The designs are gorgeous and the material is breathable. Highly recommended.it is definitely sized wrong I wear a medium and these are almost extra smallThese were really pretty and not a bad price considering you get 8 of them. I\\'m sure I would have loved these..IF THE ONES I ORDERED WERE ACTUALLY THE ONES I GOT!!! I\\'d never order from them again until they can actually photograph what you actually will get!! The print WAYYYY down at the bottom states \"you may not get exact colors\" etc.Well there are 8 pair and I got 3 doubles out of 8 total!! They show all these various pretty colored ones and what you get is 2 pair of one style..2 pair of another style..and 2 pair of another style..then one other..then one other. So what happens, which was EXACTLY what I hoped would NOT happen..I got doubles of the ones I don\\'t like so much and I NEVER GOT THE TWO THAT I INITIALLY ORDERED THESE FOR!!! There is nothing WORSE then to SEE what you want, PAY for it, then get NONE of the style you wanted!! So yes..read all the way at the bottom of their description and KNOW..you will NOT get what is pictured!! When THIS company can correct that..people should NOT order these at ALL!! It\\'s like wanting an apple and ordering it..then they bring you a lemon!! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!\\xa0That\\'s a very  cute looking panties for the price . And hey, I did not expect them to be  a high quality - I know how much I paid for them, so let\\'s be realistic here . U would not want to wear them all day long bc of uncovered elastic inside( see video),  but they would be awesome for showing off and looking pretty. One of received has a loose threads on it, but come on, I am not gonna wear them for 5 years strait , so I am ok with that. Before posting this review , I washed them twice ( in a mesh bag, regular setting) - nothing happened , and air dried - I think hot air would damage the fabric. The colors are super cheerful and omg, how bored I am of all grey/black /beige plain cotton  overwhelming the market, so those colorful panties are like a breath of fresh air ! What do u need to know : they made of thin, shiny, rustling polyester, very lightweight, become softer after washing, lightly constructed and stretch very well, have tiny cotton gusset , fit comfortably, sizing is correct ( my hips are 38, ordered size M, fit me well ),  colors are bright. Please be aware of the elastic band mentioned above - it could really irritate, so no prolong walking in this panties. Overall:  for 2.25 a pair I absolutely enjoy this flirty panties and I definitely look pretty and sexy  in them ).  4 stars instead of 5 for that uncovered elastic band.overall they are very nice, comfy, sexy, and like the picture. The only bad thing I received 2 repeated animal print, and another similar to them.. but thats my taste.. In general I dislike animal print. Besides that, Im usually size m in victoria secret and other brands, but this one run a bit smaller, still fit though. One came a bit bigger than the others (maybe an actual M size). But in general I would recommend this purchase, just check the sizes if your are not very sure about yours.Was disappointed that I didn\\'t receive all of the colors as pictured and got doubles instead. The sizing was all over the place. Definitely get what you pay for.Most of these are nice however some of the threads unraveled just after 1 wear but even though they unraveled they are still wearable. Not the best quality but not extremely unhappy with this purchase.As advertised. These thongs are cheap, sexy, and fun! They\\'re not high quality, nor did I expect them to be. My experience was similar to other customers\\' complaints about the exposed elastic. It would certainly make for a better product if the elastic bands were encased in the fabric. I wouldn\\'t suggest wearing a pair all day... these are just fun for a romp in the hay. ;)I used to be able to find my favorite thong panties in this light, satiny material at a popular \"very sexy\" lingerie store, but they stopped making them.  These come the closest--comfy and fit just right.  Great price too.After the first wear, thread started coming off. So far had to toss out 3 in a week! Poorly made and extremely unsatisfied!A.  Ummmm, those panties though, right?  RIGHT!  They are just as comfortable as they are cute! The little tie in the back is such a sexy added bonus.B.  I\\'m always amazed by how soft the lace is with this company.  It feels like I\\'m wearing something four times as much.C.  If you have very large breasts, the bralette may not hold them you well (I have that problem), but it covers what needs to be covered, and you just can\\'t get away from just how comfortable it feels and how comfortable I feel in it.I just wish the straps were a bit thicker.This is a sexy set to wear under a date dress as a little surprise at the end of the night. There’s no undwire. I bought a small. I’m a 34A and weigh 130 lbs...and it fits great!This two piece lingerie looksnice on only thing is this oneis more for skinny than chubbygirls lol it looks nice and prettyon but for me since im chubbyand im picky with how i look inmy stuff its not a go for me butits really pretty and cute. Thematerial is soft and nice andit looks as shown on the picture..I am 5\\'5\\'\\', 34A and usually wear size S~M underwear.I order S. It\\'s fit me. The underwear a little bit big but I can still wear.Extremely cute and sexy  i lovethe chest part it looks super sexyand unique for a surprise night foryour husband. I made a surprisenight for my husband using thisand he was amazed... the color isas shown and its made out of areally good material.. i also lovethe bow in the front and i like thati can do a bow in the back also...the hearts on the chest part makeit different and unique...Panties and bralette are cute but the only complaint I have is that in the picture, the bra lifts and pushes her boobs together. The real one doesn’t do any of that. No lifting whatsoever, so I stitched the front together a little bit to give me some cleavage but it’s lace so it’ll probably tear eventually.I\\'m a size 14 and bought an xxl. Fits perfectly!! Love it.ohhhh yes you need this in your collection. If you\\'re looking for sexy look no farther. Honestly i couldn\\'t keep my husband off me when i wore this out under a dress. If you want to drive your partner crazy- this is your best choice.I love it super cute better for a longer torso it\\'s pretty loose on my stomach I\\'m 5\\'2 115 got a small usually wear size 3-5 really got here super fast!I got this because my husband has been traveling a lot for his job for most of the year and I wanted to spice things up while he was away.  I sent him a few pictures of me in this while he was at work and the outfit got the reaction I wanted ;) I am 5\\'0 119lbs and the small fit perfect.  I am a small A-cup so it\\'s just the tiniest bit loose around the chest but I just pulled the strings tighter and it was fine.  I highly recommend this product!I’m 5’2 135 pound with a 34DD breast and 26 inch waist. It’s kinda small on top . Side boobs popping out it that’s okay with me . The waist area is a little loose. Bottom fits well because it’s a g-string. The matierial is good. Not flimsy. I ordered a size small. The breast area has tie string so it can be easily adjusted to how tight you want it. Overall I do like it.I love this but it def runs small. I sized up, as I always do with amazon lingerie. And I think I am going to buy another one and size up again. So go 2 sizes up maybe. The strings around the hips are small on me because my leggings size is usually a large, and top/dress size a medium. So I need to size up for the bottom half too. And the extra length would be nice since I am 5’8”. I think an extra large will be perfect. The large is very nice tho. It digs into my crotch a little, because it’s a string and it’s pullinh because I would ideally need more length .I was on the fence about this lingerie, but my man likes me in red and I liked this shade of red. I thought the cut would be unflattering but it’s actually really nice! The ties behind the breast and neck help you get a little lift on the bust line, and the lace is soft and stretchy. I’m a 32DD (28-inch waist, 38-inch hips) and the small fits perfectly. I will say that I’m only 5’4 and have a short torso, and the length JUST fits me. Girls with longer abdomens may find it uncomfortable.I am 5’9, 130 pounds and got a small . Fits nicely , the halter and back are adjustable like a bikini top, and the lace part is stretchy- was worried Id be too tall for it but the halter holds it in placeSuper sexy outfit. My favorite that I have in my closet. Fits absolutely perfect.So sexy fits great in 5\\'2\"34b 116lbs and looks amazing.I got the pink one in small. My man loved it. And so do I..When I ordered them, I expected crouchless because that\\'s what it said. They weren\\'t. That being said they are still pretty. I will keep, but am not happy. I don\\'t ever write bad reviews unless absolutely unhappy. I gave a 3 star because panties are pretty and soft. Just not what I wanted.Super cute and sexy. Nice and soft materials. Runs large. I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you. Just didn’t work for my post partum body.First of all, thank you to the company for listing a chart with their sizes in relationship to woman\\'s jean sizes. 🙌 Because let\\'s be honest, I\\'m not going to measure myself, but especially not to buy just underwear. So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front \\'area\\'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: \"Well I didn\\'t have to take these off, which I like, so more\" (He\\'s not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉Super stretchy material. I love these. Try aren\\'t the most amazing thick quality but they will work for the price.These were so sexy and I looked hot in them. I do not wear a 3X, but because they stretch I got a larger size than what I believed I wore. It fit perfectly.I went off other reviews on how they run for size and everything I read said they run small so I ordered a size larger and they are definitely larger.  They weren\\'t too large to go through the effort of returning them but would have been sexier if the fit was better.Bought for my nieces bridal shower . I think she’s going to love them ! It’s for a pantie game they’re playingThese are exactly as pictured. The XL size is a little bit on the snug side but not bad.Pretty disappointed in these. I ordered them specifically for the colors shown (black, gray, burgundy, blue, tan & white...solids) and what I got was a pack nothing like these. Seriously, it even includes one pair each of pink/purple wannabe leopard print that looks incredibly childish. Why do companies that think grown women want to wear this? Before purchase I read through trying to confirm that the colors would be as shown and I didn\\'t see anything to the contrary. They\\'ll be going back.I took a gamble on ordering these and I am so glad I did. For years I wore a traditional fit hi waist style from Jockey.  I was very disappointed to find that Jockey was no longer making that style so I have spent the past few months searching online for something comparable.  I came across these Fruit of the Loom briefs. They are made of a very similar fabric and the fit is very comfortable.  There are a few differences between the two.  These do not have a seam down the back (which doesn\\'t really matter to me).  These do seem slightly more stretchy but I consider that a pro not a con.  Be aware that a few of the colors shown online are not the same as the ones in the packages I received.  The colors are more in the pastel family than in the jewel tones as shown. This might be of importance to some if they are planning on color coordinating.  I personally will take comfort over color any day, particularly since it is for an article of clothing that I am going to wear under other clothing. I did get a black pair and a white pair as displayed. I got a bright (bubble gum) pink instead of the deep purple. I got a soft dove grey instead of the slate grey.  The blue is more like a powder blue.  The last pair is a pleasant light lavender.Fast becoming some of my favorite underwear because they\\'re inexpensive and a lot more comfortable than similarly priced non-microfiber (often cotton/polyester blends) ones.  May not be the best for you if you wear panty liners often or such products that don\\'t have wings because they don\\'t stick well.Edit: knocking off a star because I\\'ve noticed that two pairs have already come unravelled a bit where the elastic meets the rest of the fabric.  One came so unravelled that I had to throw it out.The fabric is nice, the cut is fine, HOWEVER the sizes vary wildly in the same pack. You can see in the photo the gray ones are a good 2 inches larger all the way around. They are tagged the same size but they definitely aren\\'t!These briefs are wonderful.  They fit perfectly, are silky smooth and dry very fast.  I bought them for camping and especially want them to dry overnight, which they do. According to the body measurements I wear a smaller size than I do in the all cotton Fruit of the Loom, so I ordered one size smaller and they fit just right. I wish they had come in all white, but these colors were all I could find. I have been wearing all cotton for 30 years, but these undies have convinced me to wear microfiber from now on. :-)I got Size 8. I am 5\\'1\", 169lbs, waist 28\"-30\", hips 45\". At first glance it looked like it could be too big but when I put it on, it was uber comfy. I tend to wear strictly cotton underwear and I went out on a limb with this one. It feels light and airy. Almost like I am not wearing any panties. Perfect!These are really great panties (really comfy), except one package I got had a flaw.  I have bought two packages, the second pack in late March (high-cut, size 7).  After one wash from the newest pack I noticed one pair had a hole in the seam (not a rip) where the thread had unraveled.  Not too big a problem, I thought - maybe just a one-off.  Then this morning I pulled out another pair and a large portion at the elastic had unraveled.I no longer have the packaging and I can\\'t figure out how to contact the seller.  Help!  I gave these two stars, but I hope to resolve this, because they\\'d be worth 5 stars if only they would hold together.These Fruit of the Loom microfiber briefs are very comfortable. I wear only these as they are of nice quality and stay put. I was grateful to have found them on Amazon, as I appreciate the home delivery. They are made well and tolerate machine washing time and time again without compromising their beautiful quality, feel and comfort.I purchaed this for my daughter to wear on her wedding night.  She didn\\'t want white, she wanted purple which is her favorite color.  It\\'s beautiful.  I LOVE the color!  I think she and soon to be hubby wiill like it!This nightie is extremely sexy! The lace detailing on the side is very sexy. I highly recommend this nightgown.My wife loves this. Great value for the $$$$! You wont regret the purchase.The lace is stretchy, comfortable straps, fits perfectly. I’m a size 25 or 3-5 pants. Size small shirt, about 130lbs, 36D bra size, I ordered a medium.Tenía mis dudas sobre la talla, pero al medírmelo cambió todo, es muy cómodo, suave,  la talla para mi es perfecta, la calidad está muy bien, me gusto mucho!!I love this outfit! I\\'m 138 pounds, 5\\'2 and typically wear XS. I\\'m also a 30DDD and this outfit fit in all the right places! I was very impressed because it\\'s normally hard for me to find something to fit my small waist but big enough for my cup size. I ended up going with a size S and glad I did!It\\'s very sexy looking and feels greatLove this chemise so much that I’m going to order another one.The cut is very flattering. The lace part is stretchy so it’s very forgiving if you’re larger on top, it still holds it’s shape nicely and holds everything in place, not cheaply made.I’m 5’1” and around 165lbs, the large was perfectFinally found something that looks good on even a more athletic build (a cup) I love it!!No underwire. Bra was kinda big but I have small boobs so it’s to be expected. Garter was cute. Underwear slightly big but it worked out. More pics @jnaelatriceI’m 217 at 5”3 and got a XL and it’s a little big actually. But it’s very sexy ;) I really Like it.Love it fits me perfectly my bf loves itGreat stretch & fit as expected! Fit every curve perfectly! This is my 2nd purchase from avid love & I cannot wait to buy more!Really liked the product, true to size.Good quality lingerie.  Loved itI have now purchased 4 Avid Love pieces and they all fit true to form. That’s not an easy find in lingerie. Place your order true to your size and it should fit exact.This was disappointing to say the least. The top fit but you can tell it isn\\'t going to last very long, so I purchased I believe a 36D and the underwear... oh boy... If there is a woman out there that could fit into the underwear you may want to seek medical attention, cause it isn\\'t right. This underwear would only have fit a baby doll.You get what you pay for. It’s hot/ cute. But the bra does scratch/itch you in some places making it uncomfortable to wear for long hours. If you’re going to be wearing this for a short amount of time or it’s going to be ripped off of you, I’d definitely consider buying this.Fits pretty much as expected. The bra is cute and fits well around, though the cups gap a tiny bit but still cute and wearable. I was pleasantly surprised. The underwear fit PERFECTLY. I was even more surprised about that, and comfortable too!!!! Super cute set.What a great deal!!! I’m 5’1 120 pounds and I have large hips (I’m shaped like a pear) so I was worried the panties would be waaay to small, surprisingly not! And the bra is so cute and makes your boobs look amaaaazing! Only one minor flaw someOf the lace on the panties came ripped ):Both bra and panties fit perfectly. I was surprised at how comfortable both items were. My only wish would be they sold the panties separate so I could buy a bunch. They’d be my go to!for a change the bottom fits with the top.  Loving it!Great comfy fit.Super cuteMy wife is Asian very slim, and these barely fit her. They are very nice, and the price is right, just on the small side.like itThe good:- package(s) arrived in good condition and on time- quality seemed nice- the wine color went very well with her skin toneThe bad:- TOO SMALL- As many reviews have stated (reading after purchase) this product runs small and both of my orders did not fit- Admittedly the TAG size and the US size via my mobile when I was ordering threw me off. My original order was way too small based on the confusion of TAG 36.- I ordered a second set the same day in her US size 36C, sadly both will be returned, or exchanged since they are both too small.Bottom Line:Being a guy and having no real idea of how to go up a size makes it very difficult. After discussing with her she says that not only do I need to go up to 38, but possibly a D as well. She is a true 36C though.I just wish these would be sized appropriately.Indeed, very well made! Feels very good on the skin. Very cute too!! But as soon as I started putting it in on, noticing the straps were as loose as they\\'d go, I realized I was a fool to not listen. My mistake.Another thing though, I bought white. I got a lovely off set white color. A very very light cream color. Not true white. The pitch white I needed it to be. If it had not been too small for me. I would of definitely kept it regardless. But since it was too small, by my mistake, and not the right color: Returned it.In picture: on the left is a pair of garter and stockings I bought, on the right is the panty from this set. Close. But not enough for me.I bought the burgundy set for special occasion and loved the cute and feminine design. I ordered up a size from my usual 36D to 38D. The band around my rib cage and panty fit nicely, but the cup shape wouldn\\'t mold nicely to my breasts because the straps would pull it into a weird uniboob shape. Also, the lace on the cup had to be pulled up and reshaped all the time as it rippled and rolled down continuously. I\\'m debating if a cup size down would be a better fit..The set is petty, BUT the way the strap attaches to the middle of the cup makes the lace fold. If you are small busted it likely will not do the same but on my it made this weird ripple. Too bad, pretty IVORY set. Have to returnBra and Panty are not correspondingly sized. Since you can not select the panty size, I would not advocate buyingFabric and construction were as promised.This set of underwear feels very good and feels soft to the touch. The bra\\'s cup design makes the woman\\'s body more perfect, the beautiful lace is exquisite, the translucent material of the underwear is looming, very charmingI followed the directions and ordered a size up, even though I am not a C/D cup. I figured since it was Chinese it would be small. Its more like 2 sizes too small. Can\\'t speak to quality as I was not able to try it on.Bought these for my wife, she looks very sexy in them, and she says they are really comfortable. Best of both worlds, Lol.GoodEl tamaño perfectoSo far I\\'ve ordered 5 of these shirts. I\\'ve worn and washed all 5 and feel comfortable leaving a realistic review for those of you unsure about purchasing. I ordered a 4X and the shirts fit me more like a regular tshirt than an oversized long tshirt but I am also 370lbs and top heavy. The shirts did not shrink much and I dried them on regular heat. The black did noticeably fade with one way but the others did not. From my experience I recommend washing on cold and hang drying. For the price, fit and comfort I will order these shirts regularly!!!I am 5\\'6 and 220 lbs and am a 44 DDD in the chest I am normally a 3 x and I ordered a 3x and it fits awesomely ! It\\'s soft and sexy and cute ! I will definitely be ordering more in the other colors!I purchased several shirts at the same time hoping to find some that I liked with my leggings. Must cover booty, must be somewhat flowy. I loved the cobalt blue of this one but was so unsure of what size to get. I normally wear an XL shirt, size 16. In this shirt I ordered an XXL. It fits just the way I wanted. I love the color. Out of the 5 shirts I got, this one is my favorite.Runs a little small but if you oder next size up, definitely worth it! Thesee shirts are light, thin, but very soft and comfortable. I absolutely love them! I have 4 already and ordering more! Probably every color 😉True to size and fits nicely. I usually wear a size 3X but I ordered a 4X because I wanted it to be loose. I think I could\\'ve gone with a 3X.  Matches really well with my Aztec leggings:)Love this top.Was excited to see the other reviews for this top that it actually fit true to size. I am 5’6” and wear a 22/24 (24 jeans at Lane Bryant). I ordered the 3X based on the other reviews saying it ran true to size or a little big. I wanted a shirt that covered my butt and not cling. I’m not big into leggings but have a few pair I like I wear with boots during the fall and winter. This shirt will work great for that as long as it doesn’t shrink when it’s washed. The material is soft but not too thin or see-through.The biggest problem I have with short sleeve shirts from anywhere is with my arms. They are either too tight or too short and roll up. These sleeves are a great length and very comfy. And nice for Layering over a long sleeve.  Also, the neck line is cut low but I like it that.I plan on ordering some more colors soon. The red was the perfect color and as shown.Will update the review if it changes after washingLove the materia! It\\'s not to clingy, I usually wear. Xxl and that\\'s what I ordered, 5\\'5 260 sort of large arms and it fits perfect to meOkay, if you have a longer torso, this will be perfect. It\\'s not as form fitting as I would like, but I am 5\\'1 and 115lbs. It\\'s a bit more delicate than the lace from somewhere like Victoria\\'s Secret or Fredericks, but a lot of bang for your buck.Love this!!! Super comfy and flattering. I have a belly and it does a good job somewhat disguising it. I am a 10/12 5\\'5\" and 170 pounds and I got a large and it fit great!nanSits high on hips just FYI! Wore high waisted jeans with them for my birthday dinner with Hubs and received a ton of compliments. Hubs loved it a ton too. Definitely see through, so wear a bra unless you want to nip and show em off. If so.. then nip and show away!Very comfortable, stylish, breathable.I loved it! The fit was true to size but it barely went around my hips cause the trim that connects with the straps is not elastic. I’m usually a size small in vs underwear and swimwear so i went for that, i’m 5’3”. It’s a really thin soft material and it looked exactly like the photo. I don’t think it will last though but for the price is good.Had to hand wash to get rid of the plastic-like smell. I wouldn’t recommend machine wash cause it’s SO delicate.I’m also gonna mention this cause a friend asked me.. this doesn’t hold anything in place if you maybe thought it did.. it’s extremely thin and it just stays on top of your body.It\\'s definitely a sexy lace teddy to wear! It looks exactly like the picture; I will say that there isn\\'t much support in the breast area, so be prepared for that. But it ran true to size. I got an XL and I\\'m 5\\'4\" 215 pounds. For the price, it\\'s definitely worth the money. Shipping was fast and overall I\\'m very pleased with it. I wear it often. Oh!! It\\'s best to hand wash as the lace is delicate.5’9” 145lbs. Size 6-7 pants, small-med- shirts, breast size 34 D. Ordered M, This cami was a little loose for me. The straps had some great stretch, and the fit in the hips was nice.  I didn’t care for the price compared to product received. Although beautifully designed with the hip flare, I feel as though this should be under $10.Loved it! Im 5\\'4 160lbs and purchased a large. The material is a little thin but still great.Es comodo y agradable. Lo disfrutamos entre pareja. Deja salir la exitacion.Smaller than expected. I recommend ordering s size upCheap feelingI have hypersensitive skin so I have to have panties that are soft to touch on my skin. These meet that criteria. They have pretty colors and feel good to. They are so soft. Will definitely buy again. Wish they had more colors.Meh. These aren\\'t bad, but they aren\\'t great. I am only 5\\'2\" and 130 pounds (this month) and I got the Large cuz I have a big booty and these felt like they had too much material in the front and not enough in back. I like cheekies, but these didn\\'t cover my entire buttcrack, which isn\\'t the part I want to show off, I dunno about you. I really wish there were women\\'s sizes that made any sense whatsoever.Very comfortable. I am 5 feet, about 120lbs and ordered a M. Fits well.On a positive note, these panties are pretty. However, all three panties have a different fit. One pair is super tight, one pair is slightly tight and the other pair fit pretty much as they should.Also has a large tag on the inside that’ll you’ll need to cut out. Otherwise the tag will stick out from underneath.The fabric isn’t the greatest. I’ve had to cut off several pieces of hanging threads.Looks exactly as pictured. Runs small. I had to return and go up a size. That always makes a woman feel good about herself. Lol.My girlfriend loves them she thought they were a great color selection I guess that matters for females lolFits good and looks good.Unfortunately these aren’t good quality . The bow in the front hangs downward. It’s cheaply made , it doesn’t hug your waist, they needed to put elastic or something to make it stay on !! And the issue isn’t that it’s too big it fits fine but it’s just cheap.Size XL fit perfect if you are a size 14. Great material. Very sexy panties. Don\\'t roll anywhere. Will buy more in other colors.Pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these are. The lace wasn’t itchy, actially quite soft. The slimming fit and cut feels sexy. The unsexy part is the sizing; I ordered an XXXL based on their size chart for my U.S. size 12-14, which fit perfectly. Will buy in other colors.Purchased for my wedding day to hold in everything just for comfort. I\\'m 5\\'2 and weigh 142 and have a bigger butt and thighs. These panties aren\\'t for anybody that has a butt at all. they aren\\'t very stretchy around the butt. Weirdly enough though, they have an outlined thong sewed into them and since I paid the $16 I thought why not cut out the cheeks and make it into a thong... so they work great now and they hold in that extra pouch. A little diy but hey whatever worksThese are fantastic! Great support in a lacy, sexy package. Wore them under skirts and dresses during a trip recently and they were super comfortable but held me in all the right places! Will buy again.These would have been great if I\\'d ordered a medium. I\\'m 5\\'4, 118lbs and I\\'m usually a small in panties, but these are manufactured out of the country. The pros are that they are pretty cute and have a nice light support. Order a size up though!Fits great, I bought a 3x. I am 5\\'7\" and 200lbs. I am proportionately shaped. I was planning to get a 2x but I didn\\'t want to be disappointed if they were too small or dug into my wider hips. These fit perfectly, but I wouldn\\'t say they are shapewear style panties though. Very light control. However they do look very sexy. I am 5 weeks post partum and my husband jumped me the night I wore these. They don\\'t show any panty lines, so I will be wearing them often, but they fall more into the category of lingerie than spanx/shapewear. Still, I am pleased overall. Too expensive however so I will stick to one pair only sadly.I love the material. It\\'s incredibly breathable and stretchable in spite of the fact that it\\'s supportive wear. It\\'s also strong and durable when being washed and dried, unlike other types of lace that I have bought. It\\'s forgiving yet still supportive; I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever worn any other type of control-top underwear before that was actually effective without being constricting or ridiculously uncomfortable (I\\'d even go so far as to recommend buying these over more expensive brands like Spanx or Maiden Form).As for the complaints about having to order a size up:I ordered the XXL (my size in other brands) and XXXL (the size that was recommended) just to compare the fit. Although the fit in the XXL was tighter, I found it stretched out fine as I wore them; the XXXL fit more comfortably, but the biggest difference seemed to be in where the waistline hit me and that it didn\\'t squeeze me in as much. I preferred the size up since I have a long torso and wanted more coverage. If a customer wants more support or a tighter fit, they should probably go with the smaller size.Love the feel when it’s not to tight. Ordered two different sizes to see which worked better. I went with the one that was one size larger than I normally would have ordered. All in all it felt comfortable as a light slimming garment and it made me feel sexy... sooo that ain’t bad!Complete and utter crap… The stitching does not line up. The fake lace does not line up. The material is disgusting and rough. They aren’t even worth a dollar. Worst sewing I’ve ever seen ever from Amazon. I did not even try them on. Once I touched them and realized they were sewn so badly, I threw them right back in the bag and sent them back. They also run extremely large… I wear a small size/extra small and these are clearly made for plus size.  The small could’ve easily fit someone 200 pounds. So I don’t know who they think a small is for?  If these are plus size and I missed that, then they work perfectly. Just in case someone comments these are actually made for plus size and I did not realize that.I ordered these not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised! These are a great fit, cheeky style, good quality and nice style. The lace isn\\'t scratchy, but actually soft. They are very pretty and feminine.I’m picky when it comes to underwear, theses days I’m all about the comfort but I don’t want to go full monty and and lose the sex appeal... with that said lol Either my butt is too big or these just don’t provide the coverage I hoped for bikinis.  They’re cute and comfortable, fit well around the waste but prefer more coverage around back.  Good price.These are a nylon material, which makes them stretch out throughout the day. They do not stay in place on the back at all. The top sags off my bottom and they feel more cheeky than like regular panties. Maybe I just got the wrong size and ordered them too large. They fit fine at first but stretch out and feel too big by the end of the day. I am usually in between a small and medium and I ordered a medium and wonder if a small would have fit better. I\\'m 5\\'3 and 142 pounds for reference. I don\\'t think I would buy again.Super cute! Size up if you’re on the fence. I wear an 8-10 in pants and got an extra large and they fit.The sizing is close to as expected, but they do run just a smidge on the small side. That being said, they are more comfortable that I expected and the colors are quite nice, so overall I was pleased with them.Loved the fit, very sexy. However,  don\\'t pull anything that you thi k is a hair. I pulled a nylon thread thinking it was a strand of hair and it ruined my new panties!These were pretty flimsy and really rode up in back. If you are very thin they might be okay but I’m about average and the style didn’t work for me.These are very thin almost silk but basically just like any other regular store cotton briefs don\\'t provide.  They are not as high waisted as expected and have NO tummy control other than they go over your tummy.  There\\'s no elastic or stretch to them making them tummy controlled.  I would return but i\\'d lose out $6 for shipping.  I might as well just keep them and buy a different kind.  (In the picture, these barely went over my belly button.)I guess if you don\\'t have fat rolls these would be fine.These are the most comfortable panties for women needing a high leg and waist panty.  They have no pant lines, they wash well, they are cotton crotched.  They run true to size.  They are great for no butt, no waist women as well.These briefs are really comfortable and yet they are a substantial enough material that they will last. They almost feel like they have a little tummy control. They really are no show which works for me. Will be buying another color palate. Great price!Extremely well made - very simple - no elastic bands to show through clothing, but still does not ride-up!  Full coverage, but doesn\\'t feel or look like \"granny-panties\"!  Fabric has a wonderful feel - launders beautifully.  Could not be happier!SERIOUSLY THE BEST PANTIES ON THE PLANET! Unmatched comfort - no sliding or rolling down. Breathability - so your lady bits don\\'t feel trapped. No panty lines or wedgies - and I\\'m notorious for constantly picking my wedgies. Perfect for running, hiking & playing softball....I\\'d assume most other sports/physical activities as well. They also hold in / smooth / control  your tummy area if it likes to be a tad unruly - although they are by no means shapewear. I continued to wear maternity panties for years because of my c-section incision...those days are long gone with these new found gems.Ohhhhhhhh and the value, I did not expect to love them this much after paying only $15!!YOU.WILL.NOT.REGRET.TRYING.THESE.BABIES.OUT.I love these underwear i look for this kind quite often because with a csection scar you cant go wrong with these. On top of it dont exactly feel like you wearing underwear at all. The only thing that upset me was i order a pack of 5 and received a package of 4, with a sticker on the bag that says 5.These are some of the most comfortable panties I have ever own.  I like them so much that I have ordered a second set.  My only comment is that the leg holes are a little big for my legs (not sure is I have skinny legs  are they are supposed to be that way).  It doesn\\'t bother me because they are so comfortable.I love the fit, the fabric and the height that does not ad to a muffin top on Mom Jeans.Great design figure flattering. Added bonus is that u can return for s refund which the Fredericksbof Hollywood website does NOT DO. They shorted me $100s of dollars in returned items. But from amazon sellers instead!!!!The style is nice, but I don’t care for panties with a seam right down the middle that goes front to back. Had it not been for this, I would’ve kept them. They fit true to size; I’m 5’8” and 140 and bought a medium.These are super cute. However, they did come with one of the straps disconnected, but since I have a sewing machine I just went and head and stitched it back on. Overall I think they are super cute and comfy....Love the look.  More of cheeky hipster style, than a boy-short.  But a flattering style for me, and the small cutout detail on the back is nice too.  The fit was prefect, and I was pleasantly surprised that these panties are really a pleasure to wear.Very cute. They don\\'t cover much ss they shouldnt. Very pretty and tastefulVery niceLove fredricks  of hollywood lines!Little too largeI always have a hard time purchasing panties in general never mind adding the online aspect which always make things even more difficult. I wanted to make sure that these would fit comfortably and not ride up and give me wedgies all day. I decided to order a medium. I am 5\\'3\" 130lbs I usually wear a size 4 / 6 in pants and a small or medium. I am actually very surprised at how comfy these are. I usually get my panties from vs and I actually feel these are made better. The vs ones are all lace in the back and the lace rips. These are lace also however there is a sheer liner which stops and holes from being made. Happy with my purchase!I think these are beautiful to look at. The colors are rich and don\\'t fade in the wash. But they are a little pinchy at the waist and leg holes - the elastic doesn\\'t give as much as I\\'d like for it to be comfortable. The lace can itch, especially where there\\'s also elastic, but really a solid lace panty isn\\'t really a choice made for comfort! Definitely a date night staple in my house.I was a little worried to order online without seeing the fabric in person but I was NOT disappointed. Not only these are very pretty but they are also comfortable. I wear them with jeans and these do not show at all. Great alternative to wear instead of thongs. I like the fact that it has all the different colors you might need for lighter and darker pants. I will be getting a second set of these.No show underwear is one of the most important features to me when I shop for undergarments. Luckily, I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. I do like that the pack of 6 comes with different colors, which is helpful for different color outfits. They’re surprisingly comfortable (considering the lace) and look good at the same time. Not itchy and true to size.I absolutely love these panties. Inwas looking to upgrade my panties because well basically im.a mom and the last in the house for new underwear. These panties are so comfie. The material is super soft and not scratchy at all the waste has good stretch to it. They seem to hold up in the wash well I like them. The patern is super cute.I searched for days to find some really pretty lacy underwear to go with the new bras I was going to purchase (also from Amazon). So glad I found these! They came in and the colors almost matched up to the bras perfectly. The underwear is comfortable with a mesh lining so you\\'re not scratched by the lace. Super sexy with the bras!I love these underwear. They fit me so well and they don’t leave any lines! There is a cotton liner which is really appreciated. They don’t dig into my hips either. I ordered a large and typically wear a large and they fit perfectly.These underwear are super comfy! The material is sturdy and silky smooth and also holds up in the washer! The designs imprinted are very elegant. The fit is as expected and feels like I don’t have anything on at all!! Will be buying more!!So sexyAmazing quality, I loved it! Photographed beautifully!Super great quality and very sexy and comfortable I love wearing it just for fun.This item shipped really fast! The product came neatly packaged. It fits true to size. The ribbon is papery feeling but you can kind of tell that from the picture. Don’t plan of getting another tie bc it’s not like it’ll stay on that long anyways. Looks cute without using the ribbon too. Comfortable material, not itchy at all. It looks just like the picture. I got the white one.The lace is softer than I expected which is definite plus. The ribbon is a cheaper material which I did expect, but I didn\\'t plan on using it anyways. The thong is strings that have some give with the same soft lace up front. I\\'m 5\\'4 and 137 lbs. I bought a medium and there is plenty of room left. You honestly could use this in a day outfit and no one would know.This is a beautiful, sexy robe. I ordered a XXL for my wife who wears size 14-16, is 5\\'4\", & 40G bra. She loved it. She can cover up other lingerie (or nothing at all) underneath and still look sexy and I can\\'t complain because it\\'s basically almost see-thru. Only negatives were the removable belt that comes with it is cheap and papery & it arrived with a tiny hole (1/2 a pinky nail-sized) torn in the back.I love this so much that I own it in 4 colors! It\\'s soft, flowy, stretchy, and adds just the right amount of \"visibility\" to offer the ultimate sexy experience but with so much comfort and confidence. I\\'m 5\\'2\", a size 16/18 (210 lbs) with a small C cup, and I went with a size Large so that it wasn\\'t too baggy but was big enough to still hang over my breasts if I left it open. The material is stretchy and very forgiving. It does seem pretty durable so far. No snagging or anything. I simply love it. Yes the ribbon belt is a more stiff ribbon, but it looks fine and honestly I don\\'t really tie it closed so I just let it hang. I love this so much. Especially paired with the AvidLove sexy nightgowns. Perfection!If I could give this robe 12 stars I would.  I bought it in white, but going to buy the Black as well.  It is SOOOOOOOO sexy.  The definition of sexy.  Like, sexy looks at this robe in envy.  I love the added touch of the gentle lace fringe around the edges!!  It rounds out the overall look of this robe and gives such a luxurious appearance.  I had the collar portion a bit higher on my neck to create a longer line to my cleavage.  Just yes. SO MUCH YES!  And, matching panties included!!  Other brands just give you a cheap, scratchy robe, but not this company!I just love everything about this robe and this company!I really wasn\\'t expecting these to be true to size so I ordered 2 sizes up. That was a mistake! Order your size or maybe one size up as there is not much stretch.The crotchless opening could be a tad longer.Excellent item and Customer Service!Sexy.I am a comfy cotton underwear kinda girl, but my boyfriend stated that he liked the \"lacy cheekie\" look while we were out shopping a couple weeks ago (what dude doesn\\'t?) and I wasn\\'t really eager to spend $9/pair from VS.  I\\'m glad I took a chance on these.  The lace is super soft so it make wearing them much more bearable than other lacy panties I\\'ve come across. The colors are accurate and my ass looks fantastic.  BF more than approves. I actually have even been wearing them on days that I\\'m not going to see him, that\\'s how comfy I think they are. I wear a 12 in women\\'s pants and I ordered an XL (generally I\\'ll wear a L from somewhere like target.. if that helps)I always have a problem with buying undies for my oversized bottom. First, it\\'s not so easy to find the plus size undies that were not designed for conservative grandmas.  Secondly, I hate getting \"the look\" from the cashier. So, buying plus size underwear online is the best thing for someone like me.I love these panies. Very comfortable, look flattering and colors are great too. Liners stay put, fabric lasted from machine wash just fine.These panties will give you the worst wedgies you have ever experienced. The Divine Comedy could not create a circle of hell more tortuous than these undies. There are fault lines shallower than the depth at which these undies submerge themselves into your nether region. I had lace so tightly wedged between my cheeks, that I could almost taste it. Each step became a seemingly interminable agony while wearing these.This most conveniently occurs when you are in a situation where removing cotton from your backside is not suitable, of course.That being side, they’re very cute. Just prepare to be split in half when you wear them.If you\\'re questioning wether or not to order these, do it! I\\'m sure all the plus size ladies out there know the struggle of trying to find lace undies that fit right and are COMFORTABLE.. ladies let me tell you I am over the moon thrilled with these & will Definetely be ordering more. I\\'m 280 lbs & 5\\'9 and usually wear a size 18/20. I ordered up to the 3XL because usually things run small off Amazon, They are perfect.Fit very well; very soft and comfortable.Stupidly, they put the tag under the bow. So don\\'t just rip it off or the bow will come off too. If you carefully rip the tag (since its paper) it will come off without damaging the bow.Finally a pair of panties purchase from Amazon that seemed good quality and fit as expected. Usually in the stores I\\'m a 1X or XL. I wear size 16 pants. With online ordering I\\'ve learned to order a size up and I ordered a 2X and these panties and they fit great and they seem like really good quality. I don\\'t think they\\'re going to slide down, like other panties did. I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re going to hold up nicely and not fall apart, like other panties did. And they do not run small like most others did. I would recommend these. Plus they look a lot better in person than they do online. They\\'re sexy and comfortable and can be worn with anything. If they end up falling apart or roll down I will update later!“Women’s plus size boy shorts” NOT!There is...ahem...nothing covering my cheekiness! And something creeping...like a wedgie...? It’s a one-sided thong! Maybe you knew?Oh well, also completely sheer which is not apparent in the visual shown here. They’re very, very pretty and lacey, however. The colors are great and they seem well-made. It’s the false advert that gets them the 1-star. I didn’t want these, I wanted boy-shorts. Period. What a pain in the (bare) a** to have to return them now. Grrrr....I love these. Here is a picture of the panties they sent( the upper pair) sold by Barbara\\'s, at 6 for 19$. For comparison, a five dollar pair of the same size undies of a different brand. As you can see, these are much shinier, smoother, and of a better quality than anything in Store. They have a great shape to them, and they don\\'t make you feel like you are squeezing into them. I forgot i was wearing them! As usual, I will edit after a wash, but so far, they feel amazing!For the price I wasn’t expecting much BUT actually was very impressed with these lace thong panties. In all seriousness, these are basically the same as Victoria’s Secret and way cheaper. I have been a loyal VS customer for this exact type of panties but the amazon ones are a game changer for me.I ordered Medium and received 3 Medium, 2 Small and 1 with no tag at all. No one checked the package when putting this togetherLove these!! I usually buy from Victoria\\'s Secret,but their prices are always high and not such great quality. These panties were cheaper and better quality. I put them on and fell in love! So happy!! Will be buying them again soon!!I like the price/color options. Lace is very thin and can dig into sides which leaves for an unflattering look. Pretty much turns into a G-string by it folding/rolling.These run ultra big, they’re ok if you’re into hiking them up to your belly and wedgiesI’m always a size M in department store thongs & underwear and the size M was perfect and fit as expected. The quality is great too!Not great, but not terrible. Definitely not nice enough for a sexy date night, but good enough for everyday underwear when all your fav\\'s are in the laundry. Soft and comfortable enough.Sexy, open in all the right places and elegant. Can\\'t wait to surprise my BF with them. Fits nicely. Great value for the money.I\\'m not going to post a photo of me in this because I\\'m too shy (lol) but I am going to try to be specific as to how well this bra fit.Ok, so I\\'m mid-thirties, weigh about 130, am 5\\'3\" and had my last baby 18 months before I bought this. I had stopped nursing about 4 months before buying and had also just been professionally fitted (which I highly recommend!) to determine how different I was post-nursing. I\\'m a 32 DD but I\\'ve been experiencing  the \"where did my boobs go?!\" problem since this last baby. I was looking for something with some \"lift\" and something that felt sexy at the same time and ran across this in my amazon searches. I was hesitant but decided to try anyway and bought myself the red.First of all, to get it out of the way, the underwear isn\\'t a perfect fit. :( I could shed some fat around my hips and these would be better but they are currently too snug; not comfy to wear. Too bad you can\\'t select underwear size so that\\'s where the less than 5 star rating comes in.The bra fit surprisingly well. I\\'m impressed. It\\'s a very wide band with multiple hooks so unless you have someone to help you, you can always hook in front then gently twist to the back. The straps are adjustable and not too long. The underwire of the cup fit me perfectly under and around my boob so I didn\\'t experience any pinching or stabbing in the side. I employ the \"swoop and scoop\" method when donning a bra; my girls fit very neatly in the front of the bra with no spilling over the top or sides of the front while at the same time giving a nice push up. The middle front of the bra pulls together very nicely and comfortably. I like the triangle cut-out in front as it makes it look a bit different than other bras. On me, the wide lace on the sides of the bra lays nice and flat with no tugging or rolling up.All in all, I\\'m very happy with this set and despite the sizing of the underwear, I will likely buy this again in another color soon!I am a jeans, boots, black t-shirt and simple lingerie kind of girl.  I wanted to kick it up a notch for our honeymoon.  While, at 46, I don\\'t look as sexy as the model in the picture, he thinks I do.  The bra fits well, and the panty is a bit cheeky.  Just what I wanted!!  The lace is soft and stretchy, making the whole ensemble quite comfortable.  The person in your life will love it on you, and so will you!This is one sexy lace plunge push up bra! I was really surprised at how well it fit and how comfortable it is—and how sexy—for just over $15 (at time of this review that is the price). Wow!I honestly didn’t expect much from it. I figured it would be something fun to wear every so often and if it didn’t last or didn’t fit quite as I wanted, I wasn’t out but just under $16.00. But surprisingly I could wear this under my clothes on those times when I want to feel sexy (tee hee).The panties I am not as much of a fan and it’s the only reason I don’t give this 5 stars. They are super cute, but they don’t fit as well as the top. They run a little smaller or perhaps it’s just that the band at the top is made tighter or banded in an awkward way for me and not flattering where it hits me on my hips. I wish it had a wider band and either fit lower or something to make it not feel so constrictive—I either have to pull them up and it looks ridiculous or if I try to pull them lower it just doesn’t look right.Really, I don’t care about the panties part at all, the bra is the star here and for the money I could toss the panties and not care one bit.I love the little peek-a-boo part between the cups of the bra, the lace that goes around my upper ribcage, the wider lacy straps—it’s just a fun sexy little bra. I’m glad I purchased it! For the money, it wouldn’t matter if it only held up 6 months—I did wash it in the washer and hung it to dry before I wore it and it did just fine. It’s not going to be super-supportive for every day use if you are big busted, but, again, for those times you want to feel and look sexy it’s perfect.I was so excited to find this inexpensive cute bra set, as its so hard to find cute lingerie in larger bust sizes! I wear 38DD, and unfortunately this bra disappointed. The lace material in the band is stretchy, but too loose, so will tend to ride up your back & is very difficult to get to stay aligned properly. Additionally, the biggest let down in this piece is how the cups tend to poke out at the sides near the arm pits---I am a full DD and usually always take up all the room in the sides of the cups, this was one of the oddest bras to try on because I still had what looked like weird armpit boob peeking out, but the cups also gapped...it is just cut entirely too narrow for most any bust I\\'d think.Very pretty bra... it fit well and looks good. Love the color and design. It\\'s hard to find my size 32DD but I am very happy with this bra.The top fit well 36 DD but the bottom is too small. I bought it for the top mostly so i\\'m ok with it.The bra and panties are a little bit small, But super cute! I thought the lace would be bothersome but it\\'s not at all. Great product for the price!Love this set!!! I did order a size up, because people warned it was small, and I\\'m glad I did because I\\'m rocking it ;)The item looked big when opened the package but once tried on it was the perfect fit. Material of underwear a little cheap and won\\'t be solid through the wash but for the price it was worth it.Amazing quality for the price. I already bought pink and black too. And will buy purple next time. Just hope they bring new colors like blue sky, orange or others.I gave 4 stars because its not 34c. It is a bigger size. Like 36 the bra. But its well done, good fabric.Somewhat small on me. I\\'m a 40D/DD.  Depending on the the cup size I\\'m either a D or DD.  Band is true to size.I have 4 colors.The panties fit great but the bra doesn\\'t. I ordered a 36D & it\\'s still too small, on top of that, the straps keep coming off & the loop that the strap hook goes into is starting to come off. Basically, the bra is trashThis bra is pointless. It’s so thin, not supportive, and the straps twist and get to where you can’t untwist them. Then they come right off at the end and the strap just falls off. Panties are nice.Prettyvery cheap-straps DO NOT stay on -they are detachable -bra feels like its made of paper-bow was not centered on bottoms-loose strings-Love the color love the fitIts thin and cheapA little tight, but wearable, I think they are a \\'one size\\'. Soft, well made, happy with price and purchase.Oh my gosh guys these panties are so cute.They fit great.I ordered my normal size Med. Grab some today!They are shipped super fast.This item was received so quickly, was exactly as described in the ad and was a great deal.  Would definitely recommend ordering from this seller to our friends.It looks very sexy, I gave it as a gift and received lots of question for more colors!I can order more if there were more colorsThey run someone small. Order size or 2 up.Great fitQuality esp for the cost, just have to deal with the waitThese are super cute & just as well made as any given panties. I bought them primarily for the 2 pair that were criss cross style, not so much the one with the T style string. Those two fit great, I am a size 18 (2x) with a big ol booty. The butterfly & criss cross multi bow pairs fit well, are comfy and a great find. The T with a single bow and lace \"cheek supports\" didn\\'t work for me. The lace got swallowed by my ample behind. But that\\'s ok, for the price 2 out of 3 is a great value. That last pair would certainly be fine and cute on someone with less curves. These were a great alternative to higher priced cage back panties found in stores.I usually wear a women\\'s twelve and have issues with either riding up, falling down or just binding due to rear shape.  These do none of those. Wore them all day, and were STILL comfortable AND sexy.These arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Beware, though, they run small.... even smaller than the size chart states. I usually wear a L/XL (7-8) in panties, but ordered an XXL after looking at the chart. I tried these on when they arrived and they were uncomfortably small; I\\'m returning them and will order something else from a different company that uses USA sizing. I didn\\'t wear or wash them, but the quality looks good.Comfort is the main word...  sexy and comfy in the same panty.  Unicorns!!Very cute and comfortable! So sexy! He liked them too!Nice panties, they fit as expected and are better quality than I imagined they would be.She has worn them out to dinner and walking around a mall, so wants to me tell everyone they are great. They came with many colors which she loves the variety.I wear a medium in underwear usually but the large in these were a little small. Not small enough to order an XL but slightly bigger wpuld have been nice. They are sexy but the straps get twisted very easily & they don\\'t stay in place well. I like the pair I have but probably wouldnt order again.OK so I ordered these partly in fun but skeptical because I haven\\'t had very much luck with surprise or random pick items. I was presently surprised every pair was super cute and fit perfectly. I will definitely be buying more the price and quality are fantastic.Update: I ordered more of these and once again great quality and fit! I had a small issue and their customer service was excellent! Super fast response and handled my issue quick!This was a drunk purchase but it turned out to be a fantastic deal! Will buy againI LOVE THIS!! I will absolutely buy again. And very soon.  My only regret is that I bought the smallest package. I bought 8 next time I will buy the biggest one.Took a chance on this grab bag, and glad I did! There was even one pair of a certain Target brand in there which I found funny, but all other pairs were “made in China” type brands. They are surprisingly cute and sized correctly, with one pair being a tad snug and another pair being a bit large. My only beef (or “brief”?) is that a majority of them were plain and I would have liked to see more prints. Overall, I would order again, and most likely will!These are great quality underwear. They fit true to size and they’re comfy and cute. For half the price of VS panties! I’m 5’6” 150 lbs and i got a medium. Perfect!I will definitely recommend. It would be the perfect one if you are looking for thongs and gstrings underwear pack. I received them in wide variety and very comfortable and stretchy material. Obviously, these panties were randomly selected as they said and I got most thongs and gstrings. All of them were super cute and sexy. Meanwhile, all of them came in a medium size as I ordered and fit very well. This brand has another variety pack product which is in all thongs. I would like to try it next time.Pros-Nice varietySome were really good quality.Cons-Was totally satisfied with maybe 4 out of the 20Many fit too small (definitely not the medium I ordered)Some had really obvious defects. Like tags on the wrong side and such.These packs are always a fun surprise! There are usually a couple pairs that are low quality but the others are well worth the money and fun. I’d recommend.No big deal.I bought this corset as part of a costume I was building for Halloween and I cannot tell you how perfectly it worked out for me. The fit was perfect. And the fact that it was corset in the back which gave me the option to either add more room or tighten it up made it absolutely amazing and it help me pull off my look flawlesslyNicely made of quality materials. I went with my waist size as suggested and ordered the 5x. I am typically a size 12/14 and a 38C. There was too much room in the chest so I had to wear a push up bra to fill it out. Unfortunately, the lacings were no help at the tightest setting. I would order 2 sizes down next time and use the lacings to accommodate my not so hourglass figure.So it’s not a perfect corset, but it’s $20, so for that, I don’t expect it to fit like a custom Catherine d’lish. The measurement specifications were accurate for me, which meant I had to order about 1-2 sizes larger than I usually do. The girls hang over the top and I wish it were a little longer bc I have DDD’s, am tall (5’11”), and have a long torso - but again, it’s not custom and the price reflects that. I plan to add more feathers to fill out the top, rhinestones, and replace the bra clasp side closure with a zipper.Side note - I ordered the “blue” but it really looks more of a teal color, which I prefer, but just FYI.I bought the green corset for a masquerade birthday party. I originally started with a 6XL according to my bra band size but soon realized I needed to downsize to a 4XL. I chose to stick with a 4XL because I wanted to be able to dance and do the scavenger hunt comfortably. In the 4XL, I had it tightened to as tight as possible and could still easily bend and twist. I maybe should have gone to 3XL if my aim was to actually wear a corset correctly.I am a 40DD or 38E depending on the style of bra and usually wear a 12/14 dress, 12 or 14 in Gap shorts, Regular 30 in Gap jeans, and a Large in AnnTaylor Loft t-shirts. I\\'m 5\\'4\" and weigh 200lbs fairly consistently. I have decently broad shoulders sitting at 17.5\" in width.PROs~ True to color~ Quality fabric~ Well-made for price pointCONs~Much larger at the topI normally would have bought a larger size corset. However, the small was on sale as a add on item for less than $5! When I received it, I knew it would be a little small for me. So, I used some sturdier strings to re-lace the back (it comes laced with ribbon). The sturdier strings allowed me to lace it more according to my size. Very happy with the product. Looks elegant and expensive. I will say that the metal hooks on the front can be a little tricky to latch and unlatch. And I don\\'t think it would be super comfy to wear for long periods of time. However, the boning was great, very sturdy and did not poke. Overall, it was a nice item.I didn\\'t use this for shaping, but it\\'s well designed and could be used as such for a skilled shaper. This bodice was PERFECT for my wedding dress. I have worn it several times this year, even just casually when I\\'m in the mood. There were no defects, it arrived quickly when shipped. I\\'m really impressed with this bodice. It matched my bustle pretty closely. 7 parts to the outfit, and it looked like it was a single dress. It gave good support (and made my breasts look amazing!) Not uncomfortable to wear as bodices go. The fabric is strong and I was able to pin flowers and shawls on it.Very pretty, and seems to be very sturdy.  I put it on for a few minutes to see if it would fit. No problem. I didn\\'t have it too tight or anything because I was wearing it more for a costume than function.  I even had more clothes on under it that I was going to for the costume. However, I put it on an hour later and the zipper kept busting open (and it still wasn\\'t tight, just wouldn\\'t keep the zipper). Finally - after 45 minutes of messing around and having it bust, me and a friend got it up (again - not tight at all - just zipper malfunction) and it stayed shut but I kept it pretty loose which was unfortunate as I wanted it a bit together.  Still, I do like it a lot and would even get it in different colors but would want fully functioning zipper.  The rest seems pretty quality - this should be too.I wore this in combination with the Magic Halloween Christmas Party Red Cloak.\\xa0Magic Halloween Christmas Party Vampire Hooded Cloak Cosplay Dress Costume Cape (53\", Red)I was attending a lingerie party that was fantasy themed and decided to attend as Little Red Riding Hood. This corset is STUNNING. No one believes I got it from amazon for this price! It fits beautifully, is easy to get in and out of (as easy as a corset could possibly be, anyway) and I have since worn it two more times and get compliments every time!I did order it a size above what I  usually would wear for breath-ability.They are very comfortable. Sometimes you want a high waisted underwear.I know I prefer that when I wear higher waisted pants or skirts, it just feels better to me. These are breathable and are soft. The colors are nice too. They fit pretty true to size for me.I’m a fan of the “cheeky” undies. These have a great design, that shows just enough cheek, but is comfortable as well. They have good stretch (a bit small, but good motivation!) and the cotton panel makes them breathable.This review is for the Multi-color 6pcs size small. These bikinis hugs low on the hips. I’m usually a x-small and small fits me, so I would recommend that you go up a size or two or follow the chart for sizing.Love the underwear very nice style. But I wish I would have ordered a size bigger. I already ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear. I guess I\\'ll just lose a couple poundsThese undies are sooo cute!! They did come a little small for a size smal (BUT NOT TOO SMALL) just fit a little snug - no muffin top or anything. I love the see through lace 😏😏😏😏These are truly sexy and very comfortable! Arrived packaged well, each underwear is individually packed which I like very much. Seems very durable and nice material!These panties are pretty and fit as described. The designs are gorgeous and the material is breathable. Highly recommended.it is definitely sized wrong I wear a medium and these are almost extra smallA while ago I decided that I didn\\'t want to wear ugly underwear anymore. You know, those basic cotton ones with the waistbands that are way too tight? Yeah, I feel hideous in those. Like really ugly. So I ordered these lacy ones. I just got them in the mail and tried them on. Oh.Em.Gee. I LOVE them SO much. I ordered a size larger than normal because some of the reviews said that there run a bit small (I\\'m a small so I ordered a medium) and they\\'re perfect! They feel like nothing. I feel naked, in a GOOD way. They\\'re so stretchy but still have good structure and quality to them and they feel so comfortable. I feel beautiful. I can\\'t believe that this whole time I thought I was ugly but it was just my ugly underwear. I truly believe now that everyone is beautiful and what you wear makes a difference and you should wear what makes you feel good about yourself. I\\'m never wearing pants when I\\'m alone in my house again. I might even order some more colors. 10/10Honestly ordered these hoping they wouldn\\'t roll down on me. Plesantly surprised on all aspects of these underwear! I ordered a size up based on other reviews that fit well (2XL instead of XL). I am a US pantie size 8 and US pant 14 (hips 45\"). Upon examination of all seams the underwear is well contructed. There are no seams that extend over the fabric or don\\'t extend the complete length of the fabric requiring a seam. The top of the underwear has an elastic waist around the whole top that sewn into the two layers of nylon. The front is a low rise hipster and features a full size (one sideed) cotton crotch. To top it all off, these underwear is super comfy. Personally, I find the lace and nylon to be really soft. Will be buying more!Note: if you want spandex lace underwear to last, do NOT place it in the dryer. It will destroy the spandex prematurely since it is heat sensitive.Great underwear! At Victoria Secret I usually get a size M but decided to play it safe and get these in a Large. Definitely not a bad idea to order one size up because it’s a good thing I did! Awesome quality. I wore each pair about 3-4 times already  and none seem to be coming loose. I noticed some cheaper underwear will slowly detach where the lace is sewn in, but these are holding up great. Would recommend!I received my order today and I have to say I am very happy with the underwear. They fit just perfect. I ordered a size Large, I measured my waist before placing my order and they are 41 inches and the size Large fits perfect. 5 stars!I hate undies. I haven\\'t bought any in years. I was bugged gently into buying something sexy that I would actually wear. So I looked. And I read reviews. And looked more and read more reviews. I settled on these ones. I love them. It feels like I\\'m wearing nothing which is what I like. But with these and a tee shirt on I know I\\'m not the only one who\\'s happy. I wash them the right way so the last hopefully. I\\'d buy more. I\\'m not much for recommending undies but if you need some these are really nice. Oh...side note...I have a really small butt and non existent hips. I ordered according to the size chart and they fit perfect. They do kinda dip down low in the front but that\\'s something I think can be adjusted occasionally and it\\'s a matter of preference where they sit.I\\'m 5\\'4 140 lbs with a big booty and sizable hips...and I ordered a size medium. They fit okay, I\\'m working on losing weight this month lol but if turn out pregnant that\\'d mean these chonies will not fit! The middle seam also won\\'t center without giving me a wedgie. THat being said they are super comfy compared to my regular hanes undies...the band is not tight or constricting. If I was at my usual weight even without the exercise, soft mama body, these would fit perfect. I think at the moment my hips will suffer with an indentation even without the extreme waistband constriction. So bottom line use my body for reference and compare with other reviews that provide their weight and body shape, such a helpful reference! I did receive all the undies in my order and the colors are true to the photo.The product info, Q&A\\'s, and reviews were all helpful. I\\'d say these fit as expected. I usually wear a large, purchased a large, and they fit comfortably (5\\'3\", 170 lbs). I love how light they feel. They are smooth and the lace is not irritating or stiff. I forget I have anything on!These are cute and but run on the small side. I got size XL and they barely manage to cover me up. Granted my boyfriend likes them and says they look good on me. The quality is good and the lace is awesome. Recommended if you\\'re comfortable with small lingerie.Extremely soft fabric, Very well made. basic and classic solid colors, fit perfectly!  Cute and sexy style!! Really like these and will buy more. Still very good condition after washing in a mesh bag of a regular wash.Very nice quality. My most comfortable setOrdering more now!!Not only are these undies super comfy, they are super cute too! I love that they have the string on the side to give a sexy look, but they are comfortable enough to be your period underwear. I sleep in these, wear them under dresses, and I\\'ve even switched a lot of my thongs to these. I threw away my old undies and ordered several more of these in every color.I would be sure to wash them in a special fabric bag in the washer and dryer to keep them nice looking. Otherwise they will survive anything!These are comfy and cute but not a thong! I got a large and I usually wear a 7...... 5,4 139 poundsBased on the reviews, I ordered a medium size (I usually wear small), and they fit perfectly. I am very happy with them! Cute and comfortable. They don’t look like they will last forever, but at this price, I won’t be mad.silky, durable, and fit greatThese were exactly what I was looking for, very pretty and sexy. Good fabric , so comfortable. Great price! Want all colors they have, my boyfriend bought them for me, it was a surprise, thank you, darling!  Go 1 size up from your US size for the best fit.The panties are as soft as nylon which they are but are labelled polymide which I believe is nylon (you can look it up)either way tho these are sOOO worth every single cent. I mean you get 5 for less than $20!! The customer service is totally outrageous in a GREAT way! They email you right back with questions within like a day, even tho I emailed them just to compliment. I am not being given anything in return for this review. Just look at the pictures, it says it all. They are coming out with these exact panties in cotton. I am definately  planning on getting them if my budget allows.. I\\'m a panty addict.. PURCHASE!!! Also, they are pretty true to size. I usually wear between L/XL and I got an XL and they fit nice a tiny bit big but it makes them more comfy since you dont want them super tight, not panties like these where its meant to feel fabulous. Thongs are meant to be tight. Anyway with that being said - treat yourself!!!!Size small is perfect for 34B. It’s sexy and comfortable and will look great with anything that is backless or low cut. The set is super sexy and more supportive than I expected.Fits well and looks sexy! Keep in mind you can see through the lace but I expected that. Also bought in black!This description makes this sound much more risque than it actually is. It\\'s really just a normal lace thong style bottom. The thick waist band is always a plus to avoid digging into your side. As for the top, it\\'s bralette style with a racerback, strappy back. So it doesn\\'t give support like a normal bra but is still cute and comfortable.Love the way this set feel, it is silky soft. Flattering back straps , I just love this outfit.I ordered a M I have a D breast and wear size small. I was hesitant to get a small because the breast usually don\\'t fit when it comes to sets. The breast fit great and my bottoms are big as I expected since I was going a size up.  I could have gotten a small after all! In fact This material is very streachy. The top isn\\'t cup fitting so it would fit very nicely on small or large breast. I suggest ordering the size you would like the underwear and I\\'m sure the top will fit great regardless of size !Gorgeous material, great color (I ordered red and it looked just like the picture) and the fit was great. Ladies remember to.order your lingerie a little larger than you think! I\\'m a size XS/S usually but with this set, I ordered a medium because the bra isn\\'t cupped. This is easily THE MOST flattering lingerie I own and I would recommend it to anyone, just make sure you go a size UP for this and every lingerie you buy. Trust me girls.This bra set is so comfortable!  After wearing an underwire bra all the time, I thought I\\'d give this a try.  I am very pleased with the design.  It is flattering and very sexy, and I am no skinny supermodel.  The top lace of the thong sits along my waist and covers my C-section scar and disguises my not so flat stomach.  The many straps on the back give enough support so that there is not one single strap on my back that rises up due to my breasts pulling down on the front of the bra.  I don\\'t have to constantly pull down the back of the bra.This is an adorable set. I don\\'t usually review clothes, but since I relied on other reviews to get the sizing right, I should add my own. I am 5\\'2 125lbs, 34DD and ordered a large and its perfect. The lace is soft and stretchy and though I don\\'t noramally wear thongs, these are pretty comfortable. My husband loves it of course, but the bra is also great for open back tanks and dresses! I washed this in a bra bag on gentle and it came out just like new.This set is nice for the price point. The material was smooth and soft to the touch. There was a slight manufacturing  smell when I first opened the bag, which happens more often then not with lingerie. I gave it a hand wash and it was great. I am a bigger chested woman DD and ordered a size large. The bra fit was a tiny bit small but is to be expected with my chest size. The Panties fit great and I was able to sleep in this set.I was disappointed to find out that these are NOT Ninja masks at all. They are however ladies underwear. So after trying to make them fit my face as a mask I gave them to my wife. She says they fit well and are nice because they are cotton and not the lacy kind.I work out a lot and it gets so annoying wearing regular laser cut panties that get stuck in areas they shouldn\\'t.  I bought these last week to wear specifically to wear to exercise, and they are great!  The cotton is very breathable and I no longer have to worry about wedgies.  The only thing I have to complain about is that they\\'re a tad on the small side, but not small enough that I can\\'t wear.  If you order these, you may want to go up a size just to be safe.  Other than that, they serve their purpose well.Bad bad quality. After 4/5 washes is came loose by the seams etc. ALL of the thongs not just one! I am so dissapointed as I paid a lot of money for them (South African Rands!)They are really comfortable and I would order more if i am assured that quality will be 100%Great product for the price and they are very very comfortable. I\\'m 5\\'3 and weigh 130 lbs, so I ordered the mediums and they fit perfectly.I purchased a pack of the solid colors and liked them so much that I ordered a pack of the striped ones. Both were size medium. I was really disappointed in the quality control as the striped ones fit like smalls. I have since thrown out one pair from each set as the seam either ripped or began unraveling. Please also note, both solids and striped did shrink a little after washing/drying. Had high hopes for these, but won’t be purchasing again. And so the search for comfy undies that aren’t overpriced, continues! For reference, I am 5’5” and 160lbs.I would not recommend this at all. They are made small. The cut is not even exact. Like on one pair, the left leg was tight but the right leg fit. Another pair fit right and the 3rd pair the back was sewed much shorter than the front. You cant wear them. They are trash and the sizes are incorrectBought these because I felt like my other thongs were too constricting, so I wanted to try cotton breathable ones. They are comfy, but noticeable under leggings and I wore one pair for maybe two hours and noticed a hole near the hip. I haven’t noticed holes on any other pairs, so maybe it happened afterwards and they’re just not sewn well, or maybe I got defective ones. But basically, you get what you pay for.These seem well made, soft fabric, and good colors. They are more like tangas than thongs - a lot more material in the back. Picture is of a large after 1 washing, dried on low.Fit perfectly, and when he saw them he almost ruined our evening if you get what I’m saying. Too cuteHilarious gag gift!!NiceIt’s comfortable and real cute. The bottoms are adjustable which I love since I’m bottom heavy. The bra was a little big on me but considering I’m an A cup it’s not a surprise. I ordered a medium just to play it safe. It doesn’t run small so stay true to your size.\\xa0I love this set its sexy and affordableI bought a 2xl, i usually wear a 2xl so i went with my normal size. It was literally a perfect fit and the hight waist undies are so flattering. Highly recommend!!I loved the underwear and the feel it wasnt rough at all I guess the only thing I wish it had was the straps to be more adjustable or holter to hold the boobs up higher lol ! Im at 5\\'1 and weigh 216 and size 16 I ordered it in a 1xSuper cute and comfy. The lace is stretchy and it is exactly as pictured. Hopefully i can find more of this stretchy lace.This outfit is very cute. It has a casual, sweet and sexy vibe to it. The color is also bright and amazing like in the picture. I am 5\\'3\", 135lbs, 34b. I ordered a medium, and it fits me well. The panties on this are also cute and fit, which is surprising for me. Usually with outfits like this, the panties are awkward shaped or just strings that don\\'t fit correctly.Absolutely love it!!! I am 5\\'11 220lb and wear a size 10/12 in pants and a 38D cup and the Large fits perfect!!!I was really impressed with the softness of the material. For the price you certainly can\\'t beat it. I\\'m surprised at how well it fits.I love the way this fits me!!!! It came fast and I immediately tried it on and fell in love.I\\'m a happy husband.  This item really showcases the body in all the right ways.  My wife isn\\'t afraid to wear this one, because there is nothing unappealing about.  It is definitely a hot way to spice up the bedroom.  It is see through enough that you know what\\'s there, but conceals enough to keep the imagination running wild.  We have purchased other like items, and this one really came through a winner.  Fits as expected.I am 5\\'5, 155lb, and 34c and athletic build. This fit great. This is the third product I have bought from this company and I have purchased a medium every time and have been very satisfied with all my purchases.For price, you really can\\'t beat this.  I think I should have ordered a medium rather than a small.  I\\'m never as comfortable in lingerie as I think I should be.  The top part that should cover your breasts is really small and, even though I\\'ve lost a significant amount of weight and my breasts are smaller than they have been in the past, the small top didn\\'t cover them well.  I don\\'t mean the top didn\\'t cover them well in a way that lingerie should NOT cover them.  I mean, the way the top SHOULD have covered my breasts, it didn\\'t.  Still sexy though and the boyfriend loved it too.Love this!This is my new favorite lingerie set! My boyfriend LOVES it.It fits wonderfully. I ordered a Medium and am 5\\'8\" and 143 lbs. I have a larger butt and hips, but the bottoms had the right amount of stretch, so they don\\'t cut into my sides at all or look tight. I am a 34B and the top is very flattering and the straps are not too loose. The set is surprisingly comfortable too. I wore it all day under my clothes and hardly noticed it.Very pretty. I bought the XXL, and I wear a 38 DD, and usually an XL in underwear. It fit pretty well since you can adjust the straps. If you are not reasonably happy with the perkiness of your girls, this lingerie may not be for you- it is not very supportive.I\\'m 5\\'9, 130 lb, 34B and ordered this set in a small. The top fits perfectly. The bottoms are a little more snug than I usually like, but they fit. It\\'d be nice if you could order the top and bottom in different sizes, but other than that I have no complaints!After reading the reviews, although I am a size 10, I ordered 2 packages at a size Ex-Large. I tried on one pair over the fresh cotton underwear I was currently wearing in case my order needed to be returned. I wanted to make sure I did not have those dreaded panty lines! The pair I tried on fit. I then used that pair to measure the others. Only one color did not meet the same size....the gray pair in each package ordered.As far as the reviews that complaint about the quality...get real! These are inexpensive!  I am a fan of Victoria\\'s Secret and I purchase the same type of  panties on sale for 2 pair for $25! Of course they are better quality. I save them for my special someone. I am smart enough not use them to compare the quality of bargain panties!You just have to remember: order larger than you wear, wash on the delicate cycle, wash separate from other clothes ( my reason for buying 2 packages ) and do NOT dry.....and certainly do not \"tug\" them up...that simply means you need a larger size. I have been a 2X and I know it can be awful but it is what it is.As for the gray pair...it is what it is.They actually fit my fat ass lolI bought these as a Christmas gift for my fiance and she really likes them.  A lot of her older lace underwear (mostly from VS and Target) had fallen apart, I guess from too much heavy washing, and she wanted more to replace them.  These were at a good price and looked similar to what she had before, maybe a bit more see-through than the old ones (I\\'m not complaining) and they seem to fit just fine.  This 5-pack was $16 I believe, and if we had replaced them at Target they sell those for 5 for $20, and VC would be probably $30 for 5 so buying this saved money for essentially the same product.  I guess we\\'ll see how long they last from here though.5’4, 120 I ordered the small and they fit perfectly. Great for going to bed with a t shirt and underwear without wearing a thong, and still looking cute. Will buy againLove these! For reference, I have 35.5\" hips and got the XS. They fit beautifully and don\\'t itch like some lace. I should probably size up to S on next purchase but the XS fit great and I love how they look on me.Ok these are cute and fit nice (some colors are tighter than others) but really the problem is the cotton lining. I\\'m going to get a little personal for a second. Never have I ever in my life had a problem with cotton lining placement, so I\\'m assuming my \"alignment\" is normal. This cotton lining covers ZERO of my front bits (you know, the parts you want lined), only covering my back side. The lining is about 2\" in length. Maybe I am just weirdly aligned after all, just don\\'t expect much protection from these.The reviews were right! These are really nice and soft and stretchy, not uncomfortable like a lot of lace panties. Perfect amount of cheekiness without riding up. I normally wear a 6-8 in pants/8 skirts/overall medium size, but I did order a large in these underwear because I like a smooth fit that is comfortable and not too tight or snug.Just in case you are curious --- the large fits me OK on a 38\" waist. some major readjusting necessary. Look (according to wife) and feel great!Highly recommended!I finally found a bra that fits correctly! It seems to be made for my body! It’s a glorious day! The cups are literally the perfect size for my boobs (no overboob, and very little gaping when I bend over). The underwire is not un-comfortable and it doesn\\'t dig in. I wish it was a bit more lifted, but it\\'s not bad. It’s such a fun green color, and it gives my boobs a rounded natural shape and my nipples are comfortable! The fabric is nice. And my husband likes it! Would buy again!Fit perfect!!! I am so happy I got the 2 bra sets. Beautiful details and good quality materials.Looks like in the picture, very comfortable.One for me, the other for my sister.I’ll buy more of this brand.  Highly recommend:)Great price for the set! I have a very small breast size that are pointy and spread apart tremendously. With this bra I can achieve cleavage. Mine you I love my breast size ( I don\\'t have to wear a bra all the time, very convenient when exercising. However, there are some outfits that requires some cleavage ( which is something I don\\'t have naturally). This bra helps me to have some cleavage by pushing my breast together. Straps are close enough together that they don\\'t jump off my shoulders all the time. When I wear a low-cut crop top, the front straps are pretty sexy and nice. The bra is padded cups with light weight. I\\'m not scared to bend over and fall out, the workmanship looks good. It’s still comfortable after wearing it for a long period of time. Some reviews says the panties are small, I’m lucky mine is perfect fit. If too small, I’ll present it to my sister. I’m going on a trip next month, I’ll take the bra panty set with me. So excited!!WOW!!! Sexy, hot and great price. I got this set of bra and pant, I am happy with this and really love it. The pad is moderate for me. The size that I selected which is 34B fits me perfectly. I am so picky when it comes to bras with laces because I get some itching, but this set is very soft with no problem and they are comfortable. My husband loves it. I got value for my money. I recommend this set.I bought a 36C which is exactly what size I wear in other brands. I am 5\\'6\" and weigh about 150lbs and wear a size Medium 10/12 US. The bra cup size was good, but the band ran small. And the panties were even smaller. I purchased a 38C to see if that is any bigger, as that is as large as this brand goes. If you are any bigger than a size 12, you\\'re likely out of luck. I will try to update my review once the new size comes in.I am somewhat hesitant with buying bras and underwear online because I like to try them on before making a purchase. I picked my bra size and found out that it was true to size. The only thing I didn\\'t like about this set was that you couldn\\'t pick the panty size. The panties were a little snug, but still wearable. I really like how comfortable this set was. They felt great and it was lightly padded with a small underwire. The straps on the front are so cute too!First off... I\\'m 5\\'6.5...143-144lbs....4 kids, last 3 C-section .i float in between 140 & 145lbs...i usually fit a small. Sometimes medium. I\\'m a 34C to be exact. This is the 34C set.  The panties are very fitting..only because I\\'m a bit bottom heavy... The material feels very high quality and just for that I will definitely be purchasing the other colors. It\\'s very comfortable.. Fits nice and securely. Nice lift... Makes me feel really sexy.. It even comes with the extra back extender clip the same color as the bralette in case it feels too tight around your back.. I\\'m actually loving this set very much!!Absolutely LOVE this set.  Sexy and comfortable!! Everything fit true to size and quality material. Great matching set for a night out,  night at home, or a naughty surprise for your significant other,  mines said wow... Fast delivery and nice packaging.  This has become a favorite!  Buy itWear one time to get your man excited and understand that the panties will come apartI really wanted to love these. I had been looking for a cotton pantie w/lace at the waist and legs as they are more comfortable and don\\'t squeeze. I admit that I am a very chubby girl and therefore ordered the x-large size. When they first arrived I tried them on and they actually fit very nicely maybe even a little on the big side... except the crotch was weirdly huge, it didn\\'t sag but the placement of the seams and lining just seemed OVERLY generous. Not sure if it is like that on all sizes or just graded big for the XL. But a woman\\'s privates don\\'t get fatter just because her waist does! The back seam came 1/2 way up my back-side. And now that I re-look at the photos of the item you can see that seam in the back-view photo. It\\'s actually an odd placement though which made them a little uncomfortable and kinda chaffed my tooshy. I had decided to keep them anyway and thought they would be fine to sleep in. So I threw them in the laundry. Well they shrunk... A LOT! Easily shrank 2 sizes! I can\\'t even get them on now. Super sad. Hopefully amazon will accept the return even though I washed them.The fit is great! True high waist that doesn\\'t roll under my belly. 5\\'6\", 240 lbs, and the XL is perfect. They\\'re soft, sexy, and comfortable!These are sturdy and full-coverage, but I really find them comfortable!  Smooth and pretty, very stretchy, ample crotch and high rise mean very good fit.  No extra bulges because the elastic rides at the waist.  I am a middle-aged lady with some extra padding and appreciate the slight compression these underpants provide.I was leery to make this purchase. I\\'m very happy with this purchase. They are soft and comfortable and they are sexy too! I was worried about the lace around the leg area but to my surprise it wasn\\'t snug at all. Overall they are great. Ladies if you ware a size 16W or 14W they will fit perfect.Normally I buy a size 7 in panties so I\\'m glad I purchased the XL. I\\'m planning to purchase more! Hope this review helps you ladies.Bought these because I\\'m in my first trimester if pregnancy and noticed the baby bloat already has my underwear rolling down, but not quite ready for maternity underwear yet.  These are comfortable, soft, pretty, do not roll, or ride up in the back. Definitely fit the bill of what I was looking for!Size wize, they fit perfectly! I normally wear a 16 or XL and ordered an XL and they are totally perfect! I recommend ordering your normal size.My only critique... they are kinda \"grandma panty\"-ish. They are really high waisted and full coverage. The lace does a little to dress them up and the colors are nice. Not even considering returning them, but I don\\'t think \"sexy\" is an accurate description.All in all, I like these! I\\'ll probably pick up a few more pairs before committing to maternity underwear.First off, if I hadn\\'t already washed these and tossed the package they\\'d be going back. The lace ripped as I was putting them on. I was surprised at how small they were seeing as how I sized up on them. The band was lower than I expected and they rolled down. The model had to be wearing a pair sized up 2 or even 3 times. Not nearly as stretchy as they make it look.Comfortable, sizing is correct.  A bit higher waisted than I wanted (look like granny panties) BUT they will work well under tight fitting dresses where you want no panty lines as the lace is invisible.  A bit low on the thigh too... could have been higher, but I will wear them.  Great value for $.Very soft and comfortable! I purchased the XL, but seems too high on the waist. it shorted a little after washing.Super cute! I’m in love with it. I usually wear L but I always go a size up when I order on amazon. The XL fits perfect. I am 5’6 and 155 lbs. material is great, so soft and comfortable. I could sleep in this. I love that it’s flowy bc I feel self conscious in skin tight garments. This makes me feel effortlessly sexy. Oh I would recommend wearing a bralette with this to give your tatas a boost. There’s no padding or underwire.Love the color and style. Very Cute. But No support up top and has a plastic clasp or hook to hold it together in the front. The hook seems easily breakable. The straps are adjustable, but still doesn\\'t help with support up top. If you are heavy up top you\\'ll need a bra otherwise everything falls out. It is nice as sleep wear, which is why I purchased it. But nothing stays in place up top if you are moving around or leaning over too much. Definitely going to keep it because it is really cute. Perhaps I will try another style.Very flattering fit, loose and flowy bottom hides all imperfections.  Husband loved it.Ultimately it’s not bad... it’s really... Really soft... thong is comfy too. My only issue was that it was a little big. I’m usually a size small in everything. Small in sports bras, shirts, dresses, size 2/4 in pants. If you have a bigger bust then I’d say true to size. If you’re like me, it wouldn’t hurt to order a size smaller. Plenty of room to move. My other issue was that the button was weird and didn’t stay clipped.This is soooo lovely! I ordered a size larger than I normally wear due to reviews and it fits so beautifully!I am 5\\'4\" and weigh about 125 lbs.I just love it...no need for altering anywhere...the structure of it falls so nicely in place overallI can only complain about thing.....The clasp on the baby doll cover..is cheap/doesn\\'t work!Tried it on myself over my clothes before my Daughters Bridal Shower, and tried the clasp a few times, stopped as I was scared I would break it!Hope this helpsvelvet55Love it very sexy and very comfortable. It does run small so I would definitely go a size bigger than what you are I\\'m a medium and I got a large and it fits perfectI didn\\'t expect this babydoll to be as soft as it was, very soft and comfortable. I ordered the small and it fits my petite size better than expected. Perhaps a little lose on the sides but the shoulder straps are adjustable so that helped a lot. I plan on ordering more in a different color.If you have a big butt and small boobs this is the perfect outfitGot three different colors and each set was a different size and the stitching was poor so they fell apart. Didn’t even have them for three months and fell apart.Hola buen día. Tengo bv. Una duda. Estos brasieres mi pareja no los puede desabrochar tampoco yo. Tendrán un instructivo o video para desabrochar los?I\\'m 5\\'9\" and wear a medium and 34B size, usually, and this was too big. I also ordered a medium and I was sent a large bottom size.I like it but the bra strap broke as soon as i put it on, i has to sew it back together but it looks great!Love it! Really flattering!Normal wearThese are so SOFT! perfect fit as well! It\\'s rare that anything online I order is a perfect fit but these are wonderful! Just make sure you know your panty size, I\\'m an XXL which is a 9 in usa womens size based on their sizing chart and it fit perfect.First off, delivery was very quick, and the packaging was impressive to me...upon opening my box, there was a bag with mini bags for each panty. Cutest thing ever..and the little bags they come in are so great and are little zip bags. The panties are exactly as advertised and the fit is being perfect. I\\'m 5\\'7 and about 140lbs and I ordered a medium (my usual size) and they are also extremely comfortable...plus, my boyfriend thinks they\\'re sexy...if you\\'re thinking of getting these, seriously, do it, you will NOT be disappointed!I’m 5’2 135lbs. I got the XXL, the fit is perfect. I will order again. I am Italian and have wide hips and large behind on an otherwise small frame- the material is awesome and is the perfect fit. Very flattering.I love these. They are soft, fit as expected, sexy, and affordable. My husband loves them, thinks they are very sexy. I personally enjoy how soft they are and comfortable. When washing, I recommend to put them in a garment bag for laundry because if not, the elastic part of the them starts to come apart a little bit. I made that mistake with one pair, didnt with the rest and they have held up great. Definitely recommend. For reference, I was a size 14 pants when I bought them, I am now a size 12 and they fit well still.Not very happy with the product. Beautiful underwear and colors, however, I only wore them once and there’s a small hole on one of them. I noticed the sewn areas weren’t done right. To be honest you can get better quality at Wal-Mart! Don’t waste your money on these.Very nice for the price .  Nice crotch padding fit is nice.  My body shape is hour Glass.  I tend to carry my weight in my legs and buttocks these are very nice  plenty of room around the legs  the don\\'t constrict . The stay up.didn\\'t fit the way I wanted. runs a little smallThese were cheap. I bought a size up per reviews which fit nicely around but my lady parts kept coming out of the strip as it wasn\\'t wide enough. They\\'re normal sized, never had that problem before! A few months of washes and the stitches are coming out. Cute though.When I ordered them, I expected crouchless because that\\'s what it said. They weren\\'t. That being said they are still pretty. I will keep, but am not happy. I don\\'t ever write bad reviews unless absolutely unhappy. I gave a 3 star because panties are pretty and soft. Just not what I wanted.Super cute and sexy. Nice and soft materials. Runs large. I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you. Just didn’t work for my post partum body.First of all, thank you to the company for listing a chart with their sizes in relationship to woman\\'s jean sizes. 🙌 Because let\\'s be honest, I\\'m not going to measure myself, but especially not to buy just underwear. So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front \\'area\\'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: \"Well I didn\\'t have to take these off, which I like, so more\" (He\\'s not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉Super stretchy material. I love these. Try aren\\'t the most amazing thick quality but they will work for the price.These were so sexy and I looked hot in them. I do not wear a 3X, but because they stretch I got a larger size than what I believed I wore. It fit perfectly.I went off other reviews on how they run for size and everything I read said they run small so I ordered a size larger and they are definitely larger.  They weren\\'t too large to go through the effort of returning them but would have been sexier if the fit was better.Bought for my nieces bridal shower . I think she’s going to love them ! It’s for a pantie game they’re playingThese are exactly as pictured. The XL size is a little bit on the snug side but not bad.I like that it fits to size and is very comfortable.Worth the money and items has a lot of underwear in the pack. You cant go wrong with this. They stretch and had good sturdy fabric and well made. They look like they will last a while.Online showed size 7 which is a large but I received a medium so I returned as soon as I saw size.I ordered these in a size 10, they fit like a 7 or smaller. They also don\\'t stretch much. I\\'m a size 18 in pants. Disappointed because they are a lot  of undies for the price.. the size 10 would fit if you wear a 12 pants.Buena calidad. Suaves y talla ideal. Se las regalé a mi novia con cadera 113 cm. Y le quedaron un poco justas nada grave. Son talla L.Better than VS! Very cute and comfy and you get so many for the priceGood quality and fit just right, thanks!I ordered a large and received a medium.I bought a 6 pack in medium. I am 125, 5’4, hips 37” around. The 3 pair with the lacy bottom fit very well and I absolutely love them. But for some reason the other 3 pair of the same size are way too tight. Feel like and xs. Unfortunately I’m going to have to give them to my little sister. And I really needed new underwear :(Don’t fit well! Don’t fit a nice butt at all, feel like cheap material, get caught on zippers and strings pull easily, didn’t last long. Wouldn’t recommend for adult female with a butt.Very cute but should probably order one size up. But they do stretch.These were too small. Look super cute though. Too bad. Had to return them.Though they are really cute, the sizes were inconsistent. 3 fit. 3 were too small.Daughter likes them. She’s pretty rough on clothes and these are surviving so far!I\\'m a medium and I ordered a large. Perfect fit.Sexy,soft and the price isn’t too badI have never liked thongs until I tried these. I\\'m bottom heavy, wear a size 10-12 curvy cut jeans, and ordered an XL.I started doing karate a few months ago. Every class, my standard hipster or boycut underwear would ride up to where the sun doesn\\'t shine and give me the wedgie to end all wedgies. Not cool. Not comfortable.I decided that the solution would be to wear a thong. I prefer cotton underwear over other stuff. These happened to be cotton. So I decided to give them a try.First karate class while wearing one was a fantastic, wedgie free experience. I was impressed! I tried them with jeans. Life was good! I\\'m even wearing one today. Consider me converted.This is my 2nd time offering. I first ordered the plain without lines and loved them so much I bought the lined. 5\\'5, 185lbs with wide hips and junk in the trunk and CO fits amazingly, even after wash/dry and they\\'ve held up great this far.  These do not cut into my hips,  they fit so comfortably,  even when hiking and working out.These are the best, most comfortable underwear I\\'ve ever gotten in my entire life. The fabric is thick, soft, and barely noticeable when worn. I could tell from the moment these arrived that they were perfect. From the beautiful zipper bag in which these were carefully packed, to the luxurious feel of the cloth, I was so happy to finally have found such a quality item. I\\'ve used underwear from VS to Wal-Mart, and everything in between, and I will never use any other brand than these I just got on Amazon. Super happy and extremely impressed!I love these because it\\'s hard to find cotton thongs and these are 95%. I can tell the difference! They\\'re a bit low rise for my taste. I might have sized up to fix that, but I\\'m normally a small, and they\\'re not uncomfortable. The V is nice and wide, and I\\'m tall so sometimes I have the issue of the back riding up the front if the front isn\\'t wide enough. The back isn\\'t too thick or uncomfy, either. I washed them before wearing (I hope everyone does lol), and they may have shrunk a little bit. I have super small hips so maybe that\\'s better. I\\'ve washed a couple pairs a second time now, and they haven\\'t fallen apart, but do have some strings where the sides are sewn. I\\'d buy more! Better than expected for the price.Very comfortable.I\\'m 115lb and ordered size M.Wow! Great buy. I hate paying so much money for one or two pairs of underwear. These are nice and soft and fit extremely well.Seriously I\\'m reviewing undies from Amazon??Perfect fit as I had hoped and here\\'s why:Love the combination of cotton and spandex - kept shape after wash and feels great! Very soft. I\\'m talking these are comfey. Everywhere.Not too skimpy, and not too much. Just the right amount of material width on hips.Well made and good quality - so surprised because I mean look at the price... The colors are bright and deep too. Very pretty.So yes! The price is amazing!! I can not emphasize this enough for what I received for a package of this many.And a true test again - they washed up FANTASTIC - kept shape, and feel GREAT.Tag is small and on the side - not in the way!!I bought a package of each - with the bow/deco lines, and one plain. The only difference is the decoration bow and black bead line.A giant leap to buy undies on Amazon - I buy almost everything else but I never thought... But I went for it and am so glad I did. As a gal I had to write this review. I appreciate honest reviews because they help me.I\\'m 5\\'4 105lbs and took the small. They are perfect.Great product, great price. I would love to be able to get organic cotton thongs for this price! These fit true to size, I am a size 6 in pants or a 29 in jeans, and I ordered the medium. They are perfect. Not too high, not too low. Soft, not too tight. I have not washed them yet. The only thing I might change, is to have a little less material going up your butt. Just a slightly skinnier thong part, but the sides are great because they are wide and won\\'t cause too much panty line.I read others reviews stating these run a bit small. I wear a medium in Victoria\\'s Secret, so I ordered these in a large and they fit perfectly. The material is very soft and comfortable, the lace is elegant and sexy, the husband is happy. I would definitely recommend to a friend!I have not washed or worn these yet, but so far I am pleased. They are very pretty; I love the colors. The material is very soft. The price is much better than what I would pay Target or someplace similar. I am 5\\'4\" 120 lbs, and I got a medium to ensure that they did not dig at all. They fit exactly like I was hoping, just skimming my skin. Size small probably could have fit me, but it possibly could have cut into my sides, creating bulges under clothes, so I went with the medium instead. These are more of a low-rise fit instead of coming high up over the hip bone like some do. All in all, I\\'m happy!AMAZING! In love and I will most likely purchase again. I am usually a small, but after reading the reviews I got a size up and they fit perfectly. They are super cute and comfy.The bows fell off while only wearing them once, and the tags completely disentegrated after one wash. The company said I must have received a bad batch and said they would refund me, but haven’t gotten a refund yet...These thongs are so soft and comfortable it feels like you\\'re not wearing any underwear!  Very sexy!  I just hope they stand up to the wash!  They run a bit small, so I bought L as I usually buy M.  The Ls are a great fit!  On the face of it, they look a bit flimsy, so I hope they stand up to washing!These are incredibly soft! They looked tiny but actually fit perfectly! They don’t ride, they’re extremely comfortable and a great priceThey run just a little bit small.  I usually wear a small, so I ordered a medium - and even after washing/drying, they\\'re a little snug.  Not unwearable, but somewhat uncomfortable after a full day of wear.I love these underpants. Very comfy and cute. I like my underwear a little looser so I got a medium, but they have good stretch so I would recommend staying true to size. (I’m 5’4 ~125lbs. Usually wear S/M)I like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitCorset strings are super cheap ribbon, there is no back panel so your scrunched up skin shows unless you put something else there, the skirt is made of similarly cheap material, the corset doesn\\'t shape the wearer well.  If you\\'re looking for something sexy, this definitely isn\\'t it.  If you\\'re looking to wear this once or twice, it\\'ll work okay but it\\'s a bit pricey for that purpose.Awesome for the price, can\\'t go wrong. Definitely order based on measurement guidelines - I wear a 16 and needed a 6xCorset didn\\'t fit yet the skirt did. I couldn\\'t get it even close. I\\'m busty 42dd and thick so I expected it to be tight but not being able to wear it at all has me disappointed.I ordered a lace up overbust corset. It was beautiful, and seemed sturdy. I read reviews but they must not have been for this corset, my waist is 37-38 I ordered a 5 as it was for my measurements. Waaay too big. I will reorder and go with the 3.Everything fit great except the arm straps. They kept falling down all night. But I still got a ton of compliments because this is seriously a cute outfitThis corset and skirt arrived before the guaranteed date! They fit well, the skirt is a little large on me, but the corset is perfect (I wear a 38DDD or 38F bra).Feels more cheaply made than expected. Sizing not consistent with product descriptionThe Fabric is good material. But as will most corsets I was too small. I am a curvy person and where a 14/16 in women and I bought the 4XL even loosening the lacing in the back the front would not met up to zip up ...so I just bought a 5XL which I am hoping will work ... crossing my fingers ...I get that sometimes sizing can be a bit off and am used to having to size up, but this was RIDICULOUS. Not only did I order a size larger than I normally would (I ordered a 2XL), but even that size was minuscule. Seriously, this was like half the size I expected. I requested a refund and sent them back over a month ago and they still haven\\'t processed my refund.Adorable! Normally a 9 in hipster undies and bought these in a 2x. I\\'m 5\\'7 and 240 lbs. These fit so cute and they are super soft! You could wear them all day if you wanted! Dont wear them under tight clothes because of the lace popping through. Very breathable which is a plus!I wear a 18-20 in jeans, and these fit perfect. (and my boyfriend loves them;)Hubbies new favorite panties! They wash well too and hold up great! Would recommend to anyone. They fit true to size like you would get normal USA sizeI typically wear a medium in underwear but ordered the large in these & they are slightly snug. Not in an uncomfortable, unflattering way, but they could be a tad bigger. An XL would be too big though. Inhave 40\" hips for reference. Good quality, I love the feel of the fabric, & very cute.Bought these for the wife make sure you order your size they are true to size made the mistake of going bigger and should not haveLike the look of these they fit well. Hubby bought them for me. Took off one star because the material very thin and one has ripped at the seemJust right for pantie/bottom aficianado\\xa0I like it so much and my husband loves itIt’s looks so sexy and more .I love that the top is a racer-back! Love the detail on the back of the bottoms, the material isn\\'t scratchy and the fit is great! Sometimes buying sets that are both one size is hard for me because tops I am a small and bottoms I am a medium, but this set fit perfectly. The band around the chest is super stretchy and comfortable and the straps are adjustable. Very happy with this purchase!So beautiful! So sexy!I am 5\\'2\" and 135lbs and I ordered the large thinking the product ran a little small. I am also a 38B cup. The bottoms fit perfectly but the top is too big. Also, the set is completely see through which I didn\\'t realize from the pictures. Completely sheer. Overall it is a nice set if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for.she is a 36A or 38A depending. very tough to find nice bras that fit. Ordered Large and it looks like this fits nicely (not tight) but cup is not too large like most for her.I like this set and the quality is high. However, the sizing runs large. I ended up having to tie the back instead of using the bra clasps to make it tight enough. I usually order one size up from my typical true sizing with these cheaper lingerie sets but with this one I would recommend ordering true to size.This is super sexy! It’s a soft material and not at all scratchy. I’m 5’7”, 135 lbs and 36b and ordered the small. The fit is very true to size. Love it!I like the material. I don\\'t usually buy anything lace because it bothers my skin, but this material doesn\\'t. The top is a little big for me. I had to adjust the straps, and it\\'s still a tad big. The bottoms fit perfectly fine.Love these! Very cute and a nice variety of styles, brands, and patterns.I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had as much fun opening a package from Amazon as I had opening this underwear pack. The randomness of the underwear gives you such a big variety that it\\'s impossible for you not to like them! I love all the thongs I got from this pack and I received all 20 and all the same size. They\\'re all different colors and different materials for all different occasions! I will definitely not be shopping at Victoria\\'s Secret for underwear again when this pack is so affordable and gives you good quality thongs!Our of the 20 pairs in my order that were all supposed to be small, I received 2 larges, one XL and one that didn’t have a tag. This my second time attempting to order a “thong grab bag” and this situation happened both times. I’m done.These are actually good quality and fit perfectly, true to size.  I\\'m a muscular 5\\'4\" 140 with a 26\" waist.  There is decent variety of colors and I think they\\'re all pretty cute.  I\\'d buy again or recommend.I loved getting this package because it truly was a wild assortment, I impulse bought these for fun but it could possibly be good for if you need a bump in your underwear stock. Of course they aren’t all the best quality but looking through them all is fun, I ended up giving a few away because they either just simply weren’t my style or they didn’t fit me well. There are some particular gems however don’t expect for them all to be a success, don’t buy it if you are seriously wanting some underwear but if you are looking for some fun and like to take risks go for it (i got I think the 14 pack and I gave away I think 4 pairs and 7 of the pairs are in my underwear rotation)Who knew that buying a random pack of women\\'s panties from Amazon would give me this much fun?!? I saw that there were a few negative reviews, but there were a ton more positive ones so I decided to take the chance.  So, so, so happy I did!  The package arrived in two short days, was packaged professionally, and was exactly as I had ordered.  I ordered the 10 pack and I received 10 different panties.  I ordered XL and that\\'s what each pantie was sized, XL!  All but one pair had tags on them and the one that didn\\'t have a tag was new in a cellophane sealed bag.  All labels were intact on the panties too.  I received 10 different colors too!  No repeats!  Honestly, this sounds a little silly... but if you enjoy little fun surprises this is the way to go!  It was like a little party in the afternoon when the Amazon box arrived!  LOL!  I am off to buy more.  Oh, and they fit me perfectly!  This gal is happy!Edit: bought second time way better than first and no g strings 😊Just for reference to help another buyer im 5\\'7 and wear size 16 pants. I got the xl bundle because it was the biggest so i could size up. The thing is half of the didnt fit as i already expected and they are mostly plain cotton ones. The really cute ones are waaaay to small. The blue thong under the white one fits perfectly. As you can see some are way too big and some waaaay to small. Is it a good deal still yes but beware sizing is not consistent. Overall quality tho pretty good. They are soft and feel well made other than sizing.Out of 3 different listings that have these types of random mixtures, this is my favorite! Based on looking at other picture reviews I could tell most of them were super cute. Came with all thong no g-string. Only 2 plain ones but one of which is nude seamless which is very useful.I\\'m 5.2\" 110lbs and ordered medium. (I don\\'t like them cutting into my love handles so medium fits more comfortable)I want to order a set of 10 every month to treat myself!WonderfulGood peopleThis is sexy and I love it.  Not a lot to it but I guess that\\'s the point lol.  I am a 36/38C and typically wear a size 8 jeans so I bought a large in this and it fits well.  A medium may have fit too but I didn\\'t want any muffin top or bulge anywhere and I didn\\'t get that with the large.It\\'s the most comfy piece I own. Looks super cute too. The strings are very stretchy and do not  dig into my skin for an unflattering look. I love it....so does he. ;)Wife is 5\\'9\" 135 32dd - the large fit perfectly. The color is nice, wife says it is very comfortable and she really likes it... I do TOO!Absolutely gorgeous and sexy I didn\\'t expect it to be so cute an comfortable. this is definitely worth the buy for anyone looking for a good quality set.HOT! Bought for to wear for my boyfriend on Valentine’s Day night. Fit was perfect and it is so sexy! He went crazy! I bought size large- I normally wear size women’s size 10 and it was perfect and really comfortable.For me it was semi loose in some places, but I\\'m kind of small and then big, so a little off balance. The product is beautiful and sexy. It makes me feel confident.Fits as expected! Very Sexy! I\\'m a DDD and a size 5 I can never find a good fit. This fit perfect! I baught a small!Super cute! Softer material, very flattering, fun, and sexy...the only little odd part is that there’s a stitch at the crotch are giving a v shape at the front, but if you don’t like it,’it looks pretty easy to cut apart. I would definitely order this in a different color!THIS. IS. HOT.I had doubts about whether I could pull this off, but dang, this thing is sexy as hell. My hubby-to-be is gonna lOVE this.This exposes your butt in the back, but in a way that it looks really nice. If you\\'re insecure about your body, I wouldn\\'t be worried, because I\\'m kind of chunky, but it makes everything look good.I usually order a small for clothing items I get on Amazon, but I got a medium for this one, and I\\'m glad I did! It fits me comfortably with adjustable straps like a bra.If you\\'re looking for a sexy piece of lingerie for your man, get this! You won\\'t regret it.I’m 4’11 size 6 about 120lbs and ordered a Medium it fits perfect!!! I’m debating if I want to take the bows off or not but super sexy.I ordered this as surprise for our anniversary for a fun sexy night time fun. My husband absolutely loved it!!!! I felt sexy in it and loved it because it covered all the areas I wanted it to. I would size 1 size up. Shipping was fast and the quality of the fabric was great.Very comfortable fit and made perfectly with good material as well as fit as described and looks just like the picture measurements were up to par . Teddy is very convenient with the bottom less feature.the actual fabric of this piece had almost no stretch to it,  I am 5ft 11in so I ordered an XL, and while i was able to get it on and the bottom part looked okay, the straps that go around the chest were so stretchy it made everything look weird on me and I was too uncomfortable to wear it as I struggle with my body image. overall the piece was very pretty and the lace is soft, i just wish the actual fabric had as much stretch as the \"bra\" portion did.Really stretchy good quality i am 165 5\\'5 and i got the xl and i definitely could have gotten the Lthis lingerie piece is beautiful and the color looks amazing. i wore it for my boyfriend and he loved it on me. it fit great (i got a medium and im a ddd chest size). i definitely recommend.Fit great, so far no complaints, washed once in cold and let hang dry so we will see how well it holds!The size fits me according to what’s listed on the size charts. However, I feel that I should have ordered one size smaller for waist cinching effect. This one doesn’t really cinch my waist. It just flattens my belly. And while that is a nice feature, it’s not exactly what I was expecting. The product is well made though and most of it it seamless as well so it’s very smooth under my clothes. I may order one in black but I will get a smaller size if I do.This thing really works!For sizing purposes i got small I am 4”11 and about 112 lbs , but I have a bit of “mom belly” that is very visible when I’m wearing a fitted dress so I needed this one badly!There’s so many kinds and choices I’m so glad I went for this one , the price is amazing for such good quality one and works perfectly !Fits great! I bought these to wear under my high waisted jeans. It definitely smooths out my love handles. I wish it had more lower tummy control. Try to get your correct size because if it’s too tight, you’ll get a muffin top and it may roll down a lot.Very comfortable and it feels great on your body. At first it can be a little uncomfortable because your body it’s not used to something that high and a little tight on your stomach but after the first 2 days. It feels normal and very comfortable afterwards, I love the way my body looks in them and everything looks smooth.I was very hesitant at first and was still doubting buying this as I was waiting for it to come in the mail. I love it! It doesn\\'t roll down, makes your tummy look great, breathable, and for someone who hates things, it was comfortable! I would buy it again in the future! I used it for my wedding day with my wedding dress and it made everything look great!Love love love love this! Will be wearing under my wedding dress. Flattens my lower belly fat and takes an inch off my waist. Very comfortable under any clothes and invisible. Will be buying more! I am 150 and a medium was great, as I lose weight I will prbly change to a small to keep it tight.In love with this product. It makes high waisted jeans look amazing. It’s just what I was looking for to hide hip dips. Doesn’t roll down. And I bought a size down so it stays tightNice and perfect. Make the body look and feel sexy. Nice curves enhancement. Comfortable panty. A must but again.I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them! It’s a really great mix/grab bag of different styles and cuts. There were a few hipsters, bikini fits, things, and g-strings. Roughly about 2 of each. They all fit great and she says they are all comfortable.I thought this was a really cool idea and a great deal. If she was to buy these individually, they would be probably at least 10$ each. Spending just a touch more and now she has a wide variety. These are all good quality too, some name brands in there. She especially liked the cotton sport thongs and the pink hipster.Anyhow, if your looking for an assortment of quality underwear all in one trip, but these. I’m excited to buy another pack soon!I LOVE the fact that you ACTUALLY get an assortment. I do recommend this purchase! They are amazing quality for the price and a good mix of brands. Good job. :) Will be my go to order for underwear!!!!Brands included(Ordered as pictured):Secret PossessionJessica SimpsonE-vie IntimatesMisoJoe BoxerJoe BoxerSophie B.AerieSomaCensoredUPDATE:I ordered a second set of 10. I\\'m still overall happy with the purchase and the variety I got. However, the only thing I\\'m a little upset about is the fact that I got 2 of the same exact pair as last time. But its okay, you can still never have too much lol. Still recommend.The brand\\'s I received this time are:Secret PossessionsSophie B.Sophie B.CensoredSomaIsabel Mora FantasiaIsabel Mora FantasiaGilligan & OmalleyJoe BoxerJoe BoxerOkay here is the basics of this grab bag for those of you that don\\'t want to read a paragraph of me gushing about how this is my go to grab bag now. All the panties were XL (the size I ordered) and only 2 fit a little snug but thats just because they are different brands. This grab bag is actually a VARIETY! I got 1 bikini brief, 2 cheekies, 2 gstrings, and 5 thongs. Most other grab bags say they have variety but it\\'s really just all thongs but THIS is actually a variety. I love all of them! There are some with lace, some with ruffles, and some that are classic colors which go with anything. The best brand I got was Fredericks but some others were Secret Posessions, Ellen Amber, shelley, and BPC. There was no weird smell just that new product smell that comes out in one wash. I have tried jooniya, embek, and a few other grab bag options and this is legit the only one that actually gave me more than just thongs.  I\\'m in love! I will definitely buy from them again ♡Im THRILLED with these panties. You guys, the quality is outstanding. The packaging was top notch, everything was folded so nicely. No weird smells. No silly man thongs thrown in. No random way too big pairs. Ive ordered variety packs on amazon before and have chuckled my way out of being mad that some of then were just awful. These are LEGIT! The pairs that still had tags on them i looked up online and basically, for the cost of one of them i got this whole bag. Im going to order another after i finish typing this review. PERFECT!Being a guy (yes, there are plenty of us men who wear panties) it can be difficult to find panties that fit well but these are great! I feel like they fit me perfectly and are very comfortable. There were a few in the package that were a little too small but that will just give me some motivation to shed a few pounds.  ;)The panties that I ordered and just received smell COMPLETELY mildewed it’s kind of creepy it smells old & mildewed like bad. They put a big pair of white granny panties in there like what in the world? & some of them are cute don’t get me wrong but when I tell you that these things smell like mildew & smell soooo bad like u are asking for an infection if you wear them I don’t understand why they have such bad odor & why the random white granny panties wtf!  I need a refund or something these things stank sorry like I said outside of the big white granny panties they are cute but this smell will have you at your local gynecologist in a matter of hours if u wear them omgLove it! Ordered the 20-pack. I got a nice variety of colors,materials, and style. I got 6 gstrings, 9 thongs, 2 full coverage, and 2 cheekies. Everything I got was great! Only 1 g string seemed to be the wrong size(small instead of large). But overall will buy again!These are great! I am so happy with what I received, none of them are the same and all super cute! They are well made and you can\\'t beat the price. They are a great value, you can\\'t get a single pair of decent panties for this price point anywhere!  Very please with my purchase and will most likely order again in the future.Was expecting something of less quality but goodI love it! It’s perfect fit for me and very sexy.Nice sexy fit just like I wanted.Just uncomfortableFit is perfectWay too smallI absolutely love this baby doll lingerie. It\\'s my favorite one. It\\'s super soft and there\\'s enough fabric to not make me feel like I put on something too small (I\\'m a big girl, there\\'s a belly to cover and this makes me feel S E X Y). There\\'s also enough of the ribbon that it will wrap around my neck for a front bow if I want to do that too. Very well made. I\\'ve washed it and worn it several times now and there\\'s no visible wear or tear on it. Still as soft as ever too.This is so adorable! I am 5\\'9, 180lbs, 38DD, and I got the 2XL. I was a little worried because there is basically no support in the bra area (just lace), but it turned out to be fine. This looks just like it does in the pic! So cute, reasonably priced, and the material is nice. Definitely recommend!!Good for the price. I ordered the medium and it fits comfortably but could be slightly shorter. (34D, 5\\'2, 103, usually a junior S). Maybe the S would have fit even better. It doesn\\'t provide much support, but it\\'s enough for me. Color is very nice.Love the color-Applegreen! Ordered the 2XL which equals a US Large. Fits, feels and looks great. Definitely a sexy little number that I\\'ll be wearing for my guy. Not bad on the price too! Love it!!Well, my favorite color is green so, yes to that. And the lingerie was nice too! The fit was as expected and truly.. if it ran big or small... its not going to be on long anyways ;-)Great color and great piece. Love the panties this comes with, as most usually come with a cheap thong. Wife is looking smoking hot in this. Good St.Patty\\'s Day get up for when you get home. ;)This is a beautiful outfit. It\\'s delicate and sexy. The material feels really nice.  And the panties are not a G-String. It\\'s a small thong. I loved everything about this.  The only caution is that it runs super small. I usually wear a large in almost everything (I\\'m about 5\\'6\", 165lbs, 38D). I ordered a 2XL based on sizing charts and feedback. I think it would have looked even better had I ordered a 3XL.I like the material and is very prettyI really was impressed with these, they’re stretchy and fit well.. I used them as dance wear for the stage, I’m an exotic dancer. They covered well but it give me a bit of a wedgie I guess is the best way the explain it. Had to adjust more than I’d like but over all pretty goodVery sexy ..also very small in terms of the amount of material. I am 5’4” and weight about 115 lbs and I was very satisfied. Quality is ok..they won’t last forever but the price is right.Great beach option. Doesn’t hide much and offers very small tanlines. Not for the faint of heart!Is as shown, hubby liked them too ;)Fit perfect, has a sexy V back shape and is made of a soft fabric. I wish it was lined, I cant wear it for work because its thin and a tiny bit see thruThe blue is a very pretty and vibrant color. The material is soft. They fit true to size and look good under leggings (no lines show).Material very soft and nice, I bought the pack of 3 wish it had more colors I would\\'ve definitely purchased again if you did. My husband gonna love this.Simple cute and low cute. Perfect for spray tansI really liked how comfortable this set is. It is perfect to wear at night. It gives good support and looks very sexy - adjustable straps too. A great addition to my wardrobe. I ordered black  size M and I am 5’6 150lbs.My wife ordered this for our weekend getaway, and I was very appreciative lol. The fit is perfect and I really like the color red for lingerie. The lace work is intricate and strong. Stitch work was excellent and the colors did not run on washing.I love this set. I’m size 6, ordered a medium and fits perfectly and comfy. It’s a good quality product for a good price.Unexpectedly perfect.  Fits true to size, very comfortable, covers my little problem area without looking awful and is sexy.I knew I ordered to large but I can alter the lace. The cup fits perfectly. That\\'s why I went with an XL being a DD cup. I have a smaller band size so easy fix. But the lace is super soft and there are straps that can be adjusted. Great quality top and bottom set.Very flattering! I wear 36DD and size 12/14 pants. I ordered Xl. It fits great!I like this lingerie set,looks super sexy and cute. It has a casual, sweet and sexy vibe to it. I bought Black S,it fit well.The lace is stretchy,the color is also bright and amazing like in the picture.The top is adjustable,this is what I like.The panty is also cute and fit, which is surprising for me.Perfect for couples,Wedding Night,Valentine\\'s Day and Every Special night.Amazing love the lingerie set.I bought the white one, really love this lingerie set for women. It feels great and soft. The floral lace looks sexy. The lace bra top and panties fit perfect, can adjust the straps for different. I will buy more from this shop because I really love this lingerie, comfortable to wear. I\\'m sure you will like it.I am very satisfied with the quality of these lace underwear. It is a great value. 6 pair for less that $20! Love the colors. The material is very soft and they fit comfortably. I wear a size 8 in Jeans and I purchased the mediums. The seat of the underwear was also a good size, which is most important to me! My photos are after one wash.There’s a really nice panties. They’re very soft and they fit really well. They fit as expected, not too small or too large they cover everything needs to be covered and they look really pretty, the lease is soft not scratchy which I really like  these are really nice panties. They’re very soft and they fit really well. They fit as expected, not too small or too large they cover everything that needs to be covered and they look really pretty, the lace is soft not scratchy which I really likeThese are the perfect balance between a full tush coverage and a thong. They are much more comfortable than a thong and much more sexy than a granny panty! I\\'m happy with this purchase. However, they are not what I would call seamless, but I could tell that by the picture, so I got what I was expecting and am happy.This fits as expected and looks really nice.  The material feels nice and it has a cotton lining.  Still looks good after a couple washes.Love how good I look in this undies. They are comfy but sexy at the same time. They fit just right and are very well made. I\\'ve already washed them all a few times and they are perfectly in tact. Definitely my favorite!This is a high quality product, but sized for very petite people. Be sure to order up. The panties themselves are very cute and cozy. Soft materials. Bought as bachelorette gift and bride to be was pleased!These are great quality and fit as expected. Very comfortable to wear. I have washed a few pairs in the delicate cycle and no dryer. They seem to was up nicely. I would highly recommend.These came with litte bows on the front, which my wife didnt realize ... nut nit a bjg deal.  They arent cemented on lol.  Good fit and cut, comfortable for my wife.I was disappointed to find out that these are NOT Ninja masks at all. They are however ladies underwear. So after trying to make them fit my face as a mask I gave them to my wife. She says they fit well and are nice because they are cotton and not the lacy kind.I work out a lot and it gets so annoying wearing regular laser cut panties that get stuck in areas they shouldn\\'t.  I bought these last week to wear specifically to wear to exercise, and they are great!  The cotton is very breathable and I no longer have to worry about wedgies.  The only thing I have to complain about is that they\\'re a tad on the small side, but not small enough that I can\\'t wear.  If you order these, you may want to go up a size just to be safe.  Other than that, they serve their purpose well.Bad bad quality. After 4/5 washes is came loose by the seams etc. ALL of the thongs not just one! I am so dissapointed as I paid a lot of money for them (South African Rands!)They are really comfortable and I would order more if i am assured that quality will be 100%Great product for the price and they are very very comfortable. I\\'m 5\\'3 and weigh 130 lbs, so I ordered the mediums and they fit perfectly.I purchased a pack of the solid colors and liked them so much that I ordered a pack of the striped ones. Both were size medium. I was really disappointed in the quality control as the striped ones fit like smalls. I have since thrown out one pair from each set as the seam either ripped or began unraveling. Please also note, both solids and striped did shrink a little after washing/drying. Had high hopes for these, but won’t be purchasing again. And so the search for comfy undies that aren’t overpriced, continues! For reference, I am 5’5” and 160lbs.I would not recommend this at all. They are made small. The cut is not even exact. Like on one pair, the left leg was tight but the right leg fit. Another pair fit right and the 3rd pair the back was sewed much shorter than the front. You cant wear them. They are trash and the sizes are incorrectBought these because I felt like my other thongs were too constricting, so I wanted to try cotton breathable ones. They are comfy, but noticeable under leggings and I wore one pair for maybe two hours and noticed a hole near the hip. I haven’t noticed holes on any other pairs, so maybe it happened afterwards and they’re just not sewn well, or maybe I got defective ones. But basically, you get what you pay for.These seem well made, soft fabric, and good colors. They are more like tangas than thongs - a lot more material in the back. Picture is of a large after 1 washing, dried on low.I like that it fits to size and is very comfortable.Worth the money and items has a lot of underwear in the pack. You cant go wrong with this. They stretch and had good sturdy fabric and well made. They look like they will last a while.Online showed size 7 which is a large but I received a medium so I returned as soon as I saw size.I ordered these in a size 10, they fit like a 7 or smaller. They also don\\'t stretch much. I\\'m a size 18 in pants. Disappointed because they are a lot  of undies for the price.. the size 10 would fit if you wear a 12 pants.Buena calidad. Suaves y talla ideal. Se las regalé a mi novia con cadera 113 cm. Y le quedaron un poco justas nada grave. Son talla L.Better than VS! Very cute and comfy and you get so many for the priceGood quality and fit just right, thanks!I ordered a large and received a medium.Happy wife, happy Life:-) Here\\'s her thoughtsThese are quite comfy and really turn my man on. Here\\'s what I like:Pros:  Comfy  Great colors  Access hole is very big  Nice lace for the priceAnd here\\'s what I don\\'t like:Cons:  easy to rip or snag  Rolls up if you have a tummyI\\'m a plus sized lady so finding fun sexy clothing can sometimes be a little challenging, but he got it right with these:-) I love teasing him when we\\'re at the store shopping and I\\'ve got on my sundress or when he gets the car door for me and I get in/out side saddle giving him an \"eye-full\" :-)Needless to say we\\'re both quite happy:-)Super sexy and fit as expected. However, for being \"crotchless\" they covered a good deal of \"crotch\". With a pair of seam rippers, I made necessary adjustments, but I wish they were a little more practical for \\'rushed encounters\\'.AMAZINGThese are great.  Just order a size or two up.  I usually wear L/XL but ordered a six XL a little too big but wearable.  Really like them.Quedo prefectoGreat. Exactly as shown. Fit as expected. Really liked these.Great buy. The only thing is the ruffle seems to fit in the front which kind of looks weird but still looks sexy!These are so comfy and the compression is perfect. If it helps I\\'m 5\\'4 and 190 and the xl fit perfect.I am in love with these. I am a size 1X and I was a bit hesitant to purchase these gorgeous looking panties in their largest size L/XL, I was afraid it will be too small. When they arrived I tried one of them on and these, size L/XL would fit size L, size XL and size 1X. They are soft and stretch to your shape. These luxurious looking and feeling panties are one of the most comfortable ones I\\'ve ever had. They don\\'t scratch, they don\\'t itch, they feel like soft silk. I love these so much that I will order more colors.OMG !!  I love these underwear. They fit amazing...and I am ordering another set...and I don\\'t feel like a old lady wearing them. I am 5\\'6 1/2\" and about 154 lbs and I ordered a size M/L. I wear a size 8 in pants. These are truly amazing. I don\\'t write reviews unless I feel strong about something and these are great!This was my 3rf go. The panties weren\\'t the same style, this time, but I knew they were sized the same way - extremely petite. I think I ordered these in an XL at the chance they might smooth, they do, just enough if you size 1 DOWN (that would be an XL for my porky US size 6m) of these in your correct size instead of UP the usual three. I quite like these I knickers, and all the others I\\'ve finally learned that a 6m translates into XXL. If you find some that you like (I love these, they reveal just shy of too slutty, your bum and a tiny bit if thigh lace, is completely covered by lace (the newest style is not-too-tight boybriefs, (ahhhhh!) Very, very comfortable with no ride up, no VPL, smoothing, and very, very feminine.Ordered a large (I wear pants size 8) and they fit but a little are a bit loose at back and don\\'t stay put so I actually \"took them up\" (folded and sewed crotch).  That helps bring them down a notch.  Really, nobody makes what I need and with positive reviews and nice looking pictures I just keep hoping and trying.  The overall quality/material is good and softness in back is nice but I think I would be more comfortable if they were more like shorts - and would look cooler too -- not so grannyish.  I found myself pulling them down a lot and am worried I\\'ll make holes in the lace.  Lastly, I don\\'t know how anyone can really know how panties fit unless they wear for a day, so returning is not an option.I had high hopes for these panties. I needed full coverage on the back side to smooth out the cellulite. And I needed a panel in the front to tuck in some minor belly flab. The front part is ok, the back side rides WAY up your back (like to the middle of your back, unless you really have an extra plump butt). Another problem is that the waistline is so thin, that it constantly rolls down. Then you have to adjust. And, in adjusting all day long, you end up ripping holes in the lace part. Not a good buy.These lace underwear are super comfortable. They’re seamless so which makes it even better. I love wearing them, they’re a great purchase!This is my 3rd set of the underwear I\\'ve gotten, because I find that each pair begins to tear after about the 5th wearing and washing. So they are quite fragile. I got the most see-through design, because that was the only one marketed in a S/M. I continue to buy them because they are effective in smoothing me out, and they (amazingly really) show no panty lines at all. This combination is delightful for someone who only wears leggings and doesn\\'t love thongs all the time. These panties are also incredibly soft and comfy, and also very, very sexy with a lot transparent fabric and lace (another combination that\\'s hard to find - super comfy and sexy.) Overall, I love them and will continue to keep buying them probably, but I really wished they lasted longer. Some pairs tear after the first wear and wash.I LOVE these - maybe the best underwear ever.  I am fairly devoted to cotton underwear, but I have a few pairs of synthetics for when I really need a smooth, no-line look... these are the best of both worlds.  The lace waistband is pretty and non-binding (read: no muffin-top!), and the leg openings are the smoothest I\\'ve ever worn.  I have one pair of the Dream Lace Boyshorts, but I found that those leg seams tend to roll up on me.  These don\\'t, so I couldn\\'t be happier.  True to size, too.UPDATE: After a year of wear, I still love these.  I have noticed that the lace is starting to have some holes where I\\'ve poked my fingers through.  This is probably more my fault that the product... I\\'m not very gentle with them.  Still, after a LOT of use, they are holding up pretty well - and I still love the comfort.These underwear are so comfortable, the lace is nice and doesn\\'t dig into the skin, and the leg openings are stretchy but not loose so you don\\'t end up with the underwear riding up! My only issue is with SIZING! I ordered the BEIGE size 7 & BLACK size 8.Here are the differences. BEIGE (7) were bigger w/ tag. BLACK (8) were smaller tag-less. See the photo I\\'ve included with the underwear on top of the other.My only recommendation is order different sizes and colors, then choose the best fit, and only order that color since each color/size varies so drastically. Otherwise great underwear that don\\'t show, especially for that time of the month when all you want is comfort!It\\'s hard to find underwear that looks pretty and fits well without riding up. Even harder to find it in cotton! These are the best I have been able to find without breaking the bank too badly. Even then, they are pricey in my opinion. Men\\'s underwear you can buy in bulk - 8 for $15. But not these! Women\\'s underwear you have to buy one at a time and each one will cost you $8-12 PER PIECE. But I digress ... Sigh.Pros: cotton, they don\\'t ride up for the first 6-8 months or so, wear really well as far as not getting holes, tagless - YAY!Cons: lace begins to roll and gets pilled after a few washes, stretch out after about a yearIf these underwear didn’t have such a huge thick seam, I would give them a higher stars. So bad that it digs into your skin leaving marks and uncomfortable leaves I felt it the pubic bone area especially from where the part of seam stitches fabric together near crotch piece (know Where I mean?;), not comfortable!!!Didn’t have to just throw these away after one wear fortunately as I wear them inside-out even tho kind it feels odd. I only bought them for sleeping. I do like how they don’t ride up my butt in the middle of the night.  So if it wasn’t for the seam, I would give these good reviews.I have been searching for the perfect panty for a long time. To me, the perfect panty does the following:1. Available in black (can\\'t see blood stains)2. Lace waistline (elastic that\\'s not large and flat leaves a line)3. NO ELASTIC around the leg (because all women are different and NONE of us have the same waist to hip to thigh ratio. Give me a break... no one wants elastic up their crotch or along a razor line)4. A substantial liner, for the occasional surprise-early monthly visitor.5. A natural fiber, but preferably something that doesn\\'t hold water like cotton. (beechwood fiber or merino woven to feel like like cotton would fit the bill)This panty fits all but #4. There is a double fabric liner, and it\\'s better than most panties, but it\\'s not exactly what I want.#5 is close enough, but I would prefer a fabric that doesn\\'t crave water like cotton. The only manufacturer that seems to understand that at all is MeUndies... but they have the problem with the waistline, cost too much, and also have an unsubstantial liner.I will continue my hunt, but these will get me through in the meantime. I gave them 4 stars because they are the best I have found.I need a pair of boyshorts to wear under a form fitting dress, and this pair is perfect. I wear a size 10 pants and bought the size L. I considered buying a size larger because I have both higher hips and love handles and in this case, I needed the waist band to lay absolutely flat with no muffin top. But I also didn\\'t want it to be too loose on my narrower hips/butt, so ended up ordering an L. Fortunately, the lace waist band is very stretchy and non-constricting - it lays pretty flat. Having tried it on though, I can now say even the size XL would have stretched to fit and not been too loose. The legs do roll up on me slightly, especially on the inner side. I love the cotton fabric, so comfortable!The quality is good and the cut is comfortable. However, if you\\'re looking for a \"no lines\" boy short...the material is too think and the lace waistband has some texture. Maidenform Dream Boyshort or Calvin Klein Invisible Hipster are better options.I love the fit of these panties - they cover my rear and extend up just past my hip bones, so I feel like there is full coverage, but they\\'re cute too.  Note - picture seems to show them way below the model\\'s bellybutton, but I find they come pretty close to my bellybutton - definitely not \"low rise.\"  I would not have bought them from the picture, but I had found them in Macy\\'s first and saw they weren\\'t low rise/hipsters.  Only thing to be careful about is tugging too much on lace border alone to pull panties up - after some time, the lace will tear.  Better to pull up from non-lace part.  FYI!They definitely aren\\'t tummy control, but holy crap they are comfortable. I wear a 14-16 and have a problem with everything riding up my butt. These do not. They do go up high and will show over your pants if your shirt isn\\'t long enough, but that doesn\\'t bother me. Especially comfortable under yoga pants. I will be buying more. Downfall: NOT SEXY! lol def granny panty win!Mrs. SQ reviewing here. Can\\'t believe I\\'m writing a review about underwear but these deserve one. There is nothing about these that I don\\'t like. For my body type they are perfect. For reference... body type is apple and I usually wear size 8 or 9, but 9 are always too big in the legs and ride up. The size XL here had leg openings that were just a little bit large for me but after one wash and dry, they are perfect. having shrunk just a tiny bit. They sit right at the waist, no rolling, bunching or pinching anywhere, very soft, no compression but perfectly snuggish so that it\\'s easy to get clothes on over them. After a half dozen washes/machine drying, they remain the same size. No more shrinkage after the initial little bit. The pictures shown are accurate for me (except the model is smaller haha.) Look and feel like quality garment and I\\'d expect them to hold up for a long while.These are very good quality. Softer material and comes at my belly button. I bought the for postpartum. I had a c-section. With my belly being sore up to my belly button I wanted to something that wouldn’t sit any lower. They run small which is why I gave 4 stars. I bought a large which is more like a medium. I will keep the ones I have for future because I normally wear a medium. I want to buy a larger set for now.I have lost over 100 pounds in the past year...have been looking for high waisted (not high cut in the legs) cotton underwear with some control for quite a while. This product is perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.So after two babies within a year and a half, I have finally thrown out all my thongs and \"sexy\" underwear and have opted for more conservation, comfy underwear. Sometimes I like to sleep with just a tee shirt so I like to have some coverage so my 2.5 year old son isn\\'t scarred. I bought these as those comfy sleep/hang around underwear. They are SOOOO comfy!! I gave them 4 stars though because when they say high waisted, they weren\\'t kidding. I truly felt I was putting on grandma underwear (my husband never laughed so hard). you cannot wear them with regular pants or they will stick out the top. I\\'m still in my 30s, so I\\'m not there yet...lol. They are also a thicker more support material, so while it holds in your muffin top well, I personally like a thinner fabric for sleeping. But that is just my preference. Overall though, super comfy!I have been trying to get underwear for months.  Nothing fits and are uncomfortable.  These are GREAT and I just bought more of them.  I don\\'t like bikini cut and been trying to get briefs.  I found these with the wording \"full coverage\" and it\\'s just what I wanted!  Briefs are under the belly button and not really at the waist line.  These cover the belly button and are good quality and  very comfortable.  Size is true size too I bought medium.Ive always gone the cheap route when buying underwear.  This time I decided to bite the bullet and actually buy expensive ones hoping to get quality for a change.  And boy, did I!  These feel like wearing a cloud.  No seams or elastic bands to pinch.  Fit perfectly.  I’ll be replacing all my old ones with these and will probably die before they wear out!Washes well, holds it\\'s color and shape. comfortable and good at the tummy. the only kind I want to wear from now on.I ordered this feeling a little skeptical because I don\\'t really wear lingerie let alone order it online. But this was a risk i was glad to take. I\\'m 5\\'4 and weighing around 185. Ordered the large and I love it. It\\'s a little loose, but that\\'s fine with me. Great for all sizes and body types.I loved this, and of course if you have big breasts expect to wear a bra with it. I personally prefer a bra anyway to leave a little more mystery. It really felt sexy to wear and is one of my favorite pieces.I am 5\\'5\" and weigh around 140lbs. The medium fits me perfectly! I tend to carry fat on my sides and stomach below my belly button, but this lingerie hides it. I know that\\'s suprising, given how revealing this garment is but it\\'s true, at least for me. This lingerie makes me feel beautiful and powerful, despite being so exposed. I though it was great for the price, but the quality, especially around the collar, is on the lower side. It also has a peculiar odor, which I can only assume is because of the dye. The smell did get better with washing. Another draw back, though I have been able to ignore it because I\\'m usually otherwise occupied, are the bum strings. This lingerie has no lower covering and the strings that help keep it on your body tend to slip. Overall I love this lingerie.Sturdy lace. Looks great in person. True to color. I usually am a small but I am large chested so I ordered a medium to be safe and it was too big. I sent it back and got a small. I\\'m 5\\'4\", 130lbs, 36DD.You can wear it all nightI got this for my girl friend as a surprise gift. She absolutely loves it and looks so beautiful wearing it. The contrast between her tan skin and the black nightie is simply amazing. We both love it!The item fit me well. It was a small and i\\'m 130lbs, 5ft. Of course my partner loved it too.Best product I’ve ever bought. So sexy- these panties fits as expected a bit snug just like the fabric should fit- nice and shiny looking just like the picture, got the red and black ones- my girl loves them and would recommend these to anyone that likes this style of clothing- very reasonable priceI recommend for you to size up. there is a bit of a stretch but you want to be comfortable.I really like these. I love how shiny they are and so does my husband.Looks great!Way too small for me.I’d bought this exact panty a year ago from a discontinued amazon seller, and I loved it. I had hoped this one could replace my last pair. It can’t. The quality is poor, and the sizing is even worse. “One size” my ass. I’m 5’3” and 120 lbs, and this feels like it’s going to snap off any second. I have relatively small hips and waist, but I could barely pull this pair past mid-thigh. This could only really fit a child, not a grown woman. Other than the poorly stitched straps, the rest of the panty was great. The quality of the lace was quite good.Super cute and would have been great unfortunately very misleading description fits way too small if you\\'re not of Asian or smaller stature these are not going to fit correctly on you however the seller is excellent quick to refund and did the right thingIt’s a good thing this was cheap, because it’s way too small for a normal person. Unless you’re super skinny, don’t buy.It\\'s a free size, but it\\'s from China, so they are a bit small, and tight. Very cute though!My girl looked spectacular in these. Very sexy. Very well made for lingerieFits wellI’m a transgender that wear women panties and I wear large and this are too small  I wish they make a bigger size but other then that is good and sexy .Congratulations!  You have just purchased the most comfortable, sexy, practical, pretty, bottom hugging, women\\'s panties ever!  These panties are well made, thick around the waistband for comfort, lacy leg and high cut but the front of my leg is still covered.  I\\'m 58 years old.  I\\'m a nice looking woman and  fitness has kept some semblance of a figure.  I\\'m much more voluptuous at 58  than I was a 28, but that\\'s a plus.  Finding underwear that suits all those key points is impossible.  I do not want a string in my bum, even at 28.  I think more is more, not less.  The lace is soft, almost invisible to the skin but I\\'m completely covered... I ordered a large, I wear a 10 in pants and a 12 in a dress, an XL on top.  So had I gone any smaller I would have had to return them,  Stay in your size .I  want every color under the sun, please more colors...green, yellow, pink, orange....All of  the great colors.....I\\'m ordering more...I\\'m delighted, and frankly, after years of  searching and wearing disappointment after disappointment...I\\'ll be a loyal customer...AND they came FAST!These panties literally changed the shape of my tummy, I am SO over hip hugger anything....they just don’t work with my older rounder body.  These panties  removed the lower indentation created by the low slung panties n jeans....they do not ride up, are cool to wear even in July, pretty, gave me my true waist back with no muffin top, I’m a size 16/18, bought the 2xx....can’t praise them enough , price still quite low even with a recent increase....worth do much more!I like the design and material very comfortable. Problem is that the high waist defies the purpose. Not flattering and creates the “double belly” effect. My fruit of the loom cotton high waist flatter my stomache better.These are great. They are the first high waisted panties that I have owned that did not roll. They have a slight \"hold me in\" to them but extremely comfortable. The leg openings do not bind at all - extremely comfortable. I think they look more like a 50\\'s pinup girl than Grannie panties - especially when paired with the appropriate bra. WIll buy them again.Love the colors, although not exactly the same, fit wonderfully, pretty and feminine, they do come up higher than the photo suggests, gives great line, mild compression, not a girdle, I highly recommend them! I wear to the gym, no panty line, no wedge, light weight, and machine washable.These panties wash well, last a long time (very durable), and come in great colors. The panty lines do not show through clothing even if a garment is tight fitting. I highly recommend them; just order a size larger than your usual size.These panties are ok.  They come to about an inch above my belly button so I won\\'t probably wear them with jeans unless I want the top couple of inches to show.  The tummy panel isn\\'t really as controlling as I had hoped.  They are pretty much just regular high waisted granny panties with some cute lace on the legs.I ordered a Medium, which fits absolutely perfectly.  I have a 27 inch waist and 38 inch hips, so I often have to order clothing a size up and alter the waist to be smaller, but not with these!  They’re snug, but don’t squeeze.  These are so comfortable!!!  I had no idea what I was missing.  The lace is sturdier than on any lingerie I’ve ever worn.  It doesn’t feel like it’ll disintegrate in the wash.  They don’t ride up much at all, for a full coverage panty anyway.  I was quite impressed with the all-day comfort.  I love vintage clothes and already wear a lot of high waisted trousers and skirts, so these work great with my wardrobe, but be aware that these will show with low or even mid-rise jeans.I really like this and my husband enjoys me wearing itThe look of horror on my husband’s face upon pulling these babies out of the package, helped me realized instantaneously that I had achieved the level of comfort I was after.Later that night, I slid into these butt buckets and hopped into bed. I’m back to buy a lifetime supply...don’t @ me!I was looking for a comfy cotton panty that weren’t too boring. These are them. I’m 5’5” 160 lbs with a curvy bottom and the medium was perfect. Other reviews led me to believe I needed a bigger size so I initially bought the xl and 2 xl but didn’t even try them on because they were huge. I figured the large was going to be perfect because that’s what I normally wear but I got the medium just to be sure and the medium was perfect. Love them!These panties are awesome. Very comfortable. They don’t roll down, don’t ride up, don’t get in your crack, legs don’t cut into you. They stay right where they are supposed to without any pinching anywhere. I have washed and dried them several times and haven’t noticed any shrinkage. Now when was the last time you bought underwear and was able to say all that.These are very comfy.  But they have one fatal flaw.  They are NOT as high waist-ed at the photos show.  They are much shorter.  If they were taller, they would be the perfect panty.  Bummer.I would consider this item between 3.5-4 stars. The material is soft, design is consistent, sizing however is not as consistent. See image for the black size larger than the others and the yellow is just a tad off as well. This order was expected to be a pack of L due to other reviews. I\\'m normally a M and looks like is runs a bit small. L fits like a M.I ordered these a while back and loved them so much that I came back and ordered two more packages. These panties are so amazingly comfortable! The Cotton is soft and thick. Not the cheap thin stuff you often find in cheap panties. They hold up great in the laundry too. Very pretty and true to size. LOVE THEM!!These are the most comfortable undies ever. Order one size larger than you usually buy. I usually get Hanes 5 so I ordered a 6 in these. They fit perfectly! And they look great too! Comfort without looking like I’m wearing granny panties is a major plus. I’m just waiting to see how they hold up after a month of wearing and washing before I order more and throw away my Hanes :)These are so comfortable ✅💕😁👍. Best ever.  Bought a larger size than usual and I am glad I did. Always scared of clothes too tiny on Amazon.The product it’s self was very pretty and size on the other hand I would go up at least two sizes For it to fit comfortably it did take a long time to get here I am by besides that it was coo for it to fit comfortably it did take a long time to get here, I was hoping for moreBottoms were cheaply made. If you trim the extra hanging parts on the top then it is super cute. I wear the top a lot just not the bottomsSexy and comfortableway to small I order 2 xl but it\\'s was more like a smallBuenoThese are not cute hipsters like pictured or like you would find at VS.  They are big old granny panties.5\\'1\" 150 lbs.  Ordered the large.  They do not ride or bind.  On the back side it sits low enough to rest in the buttock crease and does not show panty lines.  I ordered more.These are extremely soft and comfortable. I love them, however, they are NOT hipsters as stated. They fit more like briefs. But they are comfyI’m 212lbs, 5’7”, and wear a 16. I’m in love with these.Surprised.  Normally i prefer VS, but these are very comfortable & affordable. They\\'ve held up after several washes.  Would recommend and buy againit needs a touch of cotton!Nice stretchy material that is comfortable to wearLove these panties.  They seem to run just a little smaller than expected, but not to bad. I reccomend and will purchase again.They\\'re beautiful, but run VERY SMALL. I usually wear large/x lg underwear, these were xlg and were so small I couldn\\'t even put them on.These are exactly what I was looking for! I purchased the size recommended on the size chart (L, when I typically buy S in stores) and they fit perfectly and a SO comfortable and stretchy. Perfect to wear under high waisted clothing or with dresses you don’t want pantie lines showing through. I read some of the reviews saying the seams weren’t stretchy and was worried, but they have lots of give. Couldn’t be happier!I think these are meant for smaller women as pictured. They don’t fit this way for me being a size 13-16.Cool as air. Lovely colors and the lace is gorgeous and not at all itchy. Washes easily. No snags or imperfections. Looks great under tight clothing, no panty lines. LOVED this product and have now ordered it in a number of colors. Probably won\\'t wear anything else going forward!I wore these for a boudoir shoot and really liked them! I haven’t worn them in my every day life yet but they were very comfortable during the shoot so I’m sure they would be comfortable then too.Looks pretty even on a man. Love it.A little on the small side but useableThe briefs run way in the small side nothing like the directions.They\\'re a little tight but that is my fault because I neglected the #1 rule of online clothes shopping - leave your delusions at the virtual door and order by measurement. I\\'ll also say they seem VERY delicate, I was very gentle trying the first pair on because I think they might rip very easily. But these aren\\'t for everyday wear so it\\'s fine.  The lace pattern is cute and the cut is flattering. My intended audience (hubby) liked them and that\\'s really what matters :).  The items arrived on time too.Love this underwear! I hate panty lines, and also thongs, so I wear lace underwear as my solution. These make your booty look cute, but are also modest with TONS of different color options. My go-to to wear to work under pencil skirts, trousers, you name it!I’m 5’4 and 145lbs I ordered a XL large would have been too small but I love them. Comfy and sexyLace shrinks. I\\'m 5\\'7/145/average sized butt. I am 46,so keep that in mind. At my age, I didn\\'t care for half my butt hanging out of the bottom/back.. Before even washing/shrinking. Wanted the sexy, but a bit more coverage. My butt isn\\'t 26 anymore lol. Overall, they are a good deal price wise. If you want more coverage, go up 2 sizes.I ordered these a month ago before my SD trip, they came quick and fit phenomenally. I love lace underwear and these fit in just the right places. I just ordered my second batch and they will be here today, I ordered a size smaller because I\\'m losing weight. Get your size and the material is not cheap feeling, it feels like VS trust me people. I wish you guys would make other colors.The quality of the underwear is fine but they run very small. I am a size 10 and ordered large. They are tight on me. I tried on a pair and therefore assume I will not be able to return them so I\\'ll just give them to my daughter. She is a size 6 and they fit her fine. Honestly I am a medium or large in just about everything so it is very surprising that these large are so tight. Disappointed!I LOVE THESE UNDIES!  Why?  Because it fits to your shape and does not create god-awful panty lines ANYWHERE.  I had always been apprehensive about lace undies because it just looks like it would be scratchy for my skin, but it’s soft and stretchy lace.  I love that it gives you the look of wearing thongs - without wearing thongs!!  I’m talking about from the butt-crack area.  I didn’t know how else to explain it.  But, i guess the best part is how it does not create panty lines.  RECOMMENDThey run small and they are not made too well. They wont last long but the price is right.Surprisingly good quality for $15. Material is thin, but stretches a little so it\\'s flattering and not constructive or baggy. I\\'m 5\\'7, 130 pounds, 32C and ordered a small. I have larger hips and the bottoms are snugAmazing. Honestly I expected it to be somewhat poor quality but it has blown me away. The bottoms are SO cute on and are very well made and the top looks very cute on, it isnt the best quality around but that doesnt really show when it\\'s on! Very pleased, going to order in another color. I\\'m 5\\' 5\" 165lbs and I ordered the large and it fits pretty well!I bought this for my girlfriend and it looks incredible. The blue is like a midnight blue, and it looks stunning against her skin tone. Also, the price is decent for something I’m just going to rip off her body immeditly after she puts it on.This is nice. There is some stretch in the fabric so it lays nicely. I wear a 36A and the cup is perfect.I’ll start with the positive of this. My measurements are 36/28/36 with D breaths and the Large fit my very well.  It was not too tight Or too lose anywhere.  The color was as expected and the fabric was soft and comfortable. My problem with this piece was the “fringe” pattern on the bra cups, on the fabric under the bra cups, and on the panty.  Instead of it being a quality fringe, it was just some threads that were sparse and cheap looking.  Over all, they made the piece look unfinished and almost ragged.  Even if you washed the set and laid it flat to dry, I don’t think the fringe threads would ever be straight or nice looking.  If it weren’t for the fringe I would’ve kept this piece.  But, ultimately, even cutting them off was just too big a hassle.Beautiful lingerie especially for the price and fits well.comfortable and sexyWell made and sexyThey  are pretty and fit well. I would give it  zero stars if possible because unlike the product description, The crotch is not cotton, probably nylon.\"  COTTON CROTCH : Crotches is made with Cotton to protect the private parts of female. The lace doesn\\'t irritate the private parts.\"The above statement is prominently featured on the product page. The crotch is not cotton, it\\'s probably nylon.. if you\\'re a woman, you want your panty crotch to be made of a breathable fabric no matter what the rest of the panty is  made from. If the crotch area does not breathe  your chances of winding up with a yeast infection are fairly high!I love these! So comfortable and fit great. Ordered XL and I wear 14-16 jeans.\\xa0I am so happy with these panties. They are super comfortable yet so feminine. The lace feels high quality and it stretches very well. I am 5’3” and 120lb and small fits me well so I think it is true to size. One thing that I always look for when I buy new panties is the comfortable crotch because if it’s too narrow, it is really uncomfortable. This panty has a wide comfortable crotch. For me, this is a gem. Because it is not that easy to find cute lace panties with wide comfortable crotch. I will purchase this again. Totally recommend!!I love these! They fit perfectly and make me look great! The colors were exactly as described. I only wish I could get more in different colors. **Make sure you don\\'t throw these in the dryer! I didn\\'t try, but I\\'m sure they wouldn\\'t do well.The color is perfect**Edited, I ordered another set and they are made different. I thought they were shrunk by a previous owner and asked for a replacement. Same thing. Made slightly different than the first set, that I LOVED.  Turns out the first set was a different brand. Prima Valentina. That\\'s the brand I want! The Barbra ones SUCK! Now I have 2 orders that are useless.I was so happy to receive this package as quickly as it came. I love the product, it fits my hips and curves very well, doesn\\'t crawl and looks beautiful. Can\\'t wait to get more from this company!I love them! Soft fabric and stylish! Excellent value!My girlfriend bought this for our 6 month anniversary. Red dress, red heels and white stockings. WOW! This was a nice surprise to say the least!Husband bought these. They are made just like the product photo.Material could be nicer but it got the job done!Runs smallThis is a beautiful piece of night ware. I rely on reviews when purchasing products esp clothing so I am going to say what I like and don’t like (there isn’t much).The color is perfect. It is a wonderful peacock teal, spot on. The fit is is almost perfect. It makes me feel beautiful and sexy for my husband even after having multiple children and surgeries. It flows right over the tummy and just to right below the buttocks. Shows all the right places. The top ties so you can adjust it.  I’m a 36C and I look pretty good.  So if you are bigger this will be great and if you are smaller you can just tighten the ties and it will look great too.The only thing I don’t like, and it’s not even that I don’t like it if I’d gotten a smaller size it wouldn’t bother me. There’s a “x” of fabric between the lace of the breasts and it’s loose on me.  I have to get a larger sizes due to a large rib cage because of lung problems.So even if you are a 40 something ☺️ or older woman who doesn\\'t have a \"perfect\" body (no one does) this is pardon the pun perfect.I\\'m a 16/18 sized gal, plenty of curves and this fit every one of them! No issues with fit the lace wasn\\'t scratchy! Going to have to see about other colors!!If you have a big bust line, pass on this one. I am a 38L (us), and it just did nothing for me when i tried it on.  It is super pretty, and somebody with a smaller bust would look fantastic in this. The panties look like they would fit great (i sent it back so never tried those on).Material is soft and comfortable and the color is nice. Appears to be of good quality, we will see after the wash. My only complaint was the size. I ordered a medium for my lady. Shes around 130lbs with a little junk in the trunk and dd up top. I should have ordered a small. It was a little loose looking in the panties. Overall though, id buy again.I ordered and received fast. It looks heavenly on. Fits great, and I love the yellow. I have so many but none of them in yellow, so happy to see this color. Whoo Hoo. My favorite, my hubby\\'s favorite too. Looks awesome against a dark tan. Now, need one in peach and lavender. Lol.I have a couple very similar to this from other brands & I love the support the other brands provide bc of the halter style.  This doesn\\'t have that support sadlyBeautiful product but to large in the chest will return and get a smaller size rubs large in the chest area but gorgeous and comfyI just tried on the lingerie! Omg I love it so much!! It fits me perfect!I love it super cute fits just right I\\'m 5\\'2 115 got a small usually wear size 3-5 really got here super fast! Really good material best out of all the lingerie I got so far.As a 36D, I have a better chance of meeting the pope for breakfast vs. this top fitting me. It\\'s like preteen training bra small.Fits perfectly! The material is also pretty forgiving and stretchy. I have a B cup and a bigger butt, and yet everything fit perfectly! It’s actually pretty soft and comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  The garter straps are awesome too! I have never used this type before only the clasps but oh man everything stayed in place! I love these so much better!!!I look and feel amazing in this outfit, I highly recommend it to everyone.I also would like to mention just how amazing this seller is! My top had a snag in it when I opened it.. it was too late to send back for when I needed it. Long story short I contacted the seller and they shipped me a replacement right away! They absolutely stand behind their word, I would buy from anyone with this lodgic any day! I will buy from this seller again\\xa0Order 1 size up if you have huge breast. I can’t remember if I ordered m or L . But my outfit fitted well but it was a little tight in boob area . My cup size is 34DDDI’m 5’5 and 165lbs, normally wear a size 8 in jeans, 34B bra and medium-large sized panties, depending on the brand. I ordered a large in this lingerie set after reading reviews, but I feel as if I should have stuck with my normal size of medium. The bralette in this set fit me but was looser than I would have liked even with the chest band at the tightest setting. Still sexy, though... the garter belt also fit, but was once again a bit loose, even on the tightest hook. If I would have ordered a medium, both of these would have probably been perfect for me, but I kept the set anyways and still rock it. The panties were much too small for me. Tight, uncomfortable, the “triangular” portion that’s supposed to cover your goods in the front  was much too small. I just threw them away and wore a different pair of black lace panties that I already owned. All in all, good set, just stick to ordering your normal size and be prepared to replace the panties (I feel like that’s a common problem with most lingerie sets you order online). My boyfriend thought this set was incredibly sexy. PS - IT DOES NOT COME WITH THIGH HIGHS OR STOCKING OF ANY KIND - YOU HAVE TO ORDER THOSE SEPARATELY!My Guy Couldn\\'t Wait To Take This Off Me 😘Pros:Lace is very see through, more so than the picture suggestsIt is actually quite comfortableConsI bought a large, the bra fit me fine however neither of the underwear pieces fit around my hips.Does not come with stockings, thought it didMaterial is very flimsy, though I expect as much with lace.Honestly because of how cheap it was I might just buy a second one anyway in a larger size so I can have fitting underwear. For the record I\\'m a muscular build 5\\'10 and weigh 220, and I bought a large.I purchased a size Large. Based on most reviews, it should fit true to size... unless you have breasts -of any size. I was blown away. The bottoms fit nicely (I\\'m a size 10). I expected the top to be a little tight, but what\\'s odd is that there is NO give or stretch in the material for the bralett cup. It\\'s a straight across piece of lacy fabric that makes your breasts look smashed and odd. Without any stretch in the cup fabric, it pulls the underwire away from your chest for an overall awkward appearance. It\\'s too bad, because the design is really cute.if you have nice boobs this will look much better.. David wife here..nanI\\'m 5\\'6, size 10, 36D, 33\" waist, 41\" hips. I ordered this set in a 38D black and red bc I didn\\'t want it to be too tight. There isn\\'t much of a push-up, though. As you can tell from the photos, it fits like a regular bra, but both pieces of the set fit comfortably and look great.It runs a little small but it\\'s surprisingly comfortable and supportive for a set like this, which is not easy to find for women my size. My normal size is 40D and that is what I ordered, pants size is 16... haven\\'t tried the panties yet but they look nice. The bra alone is worth the price. Love the way it looks and feels. The side support wires bend and flex around my underarm fat which isn\\'t the prettiest but at least they don\\'t poke. Would buy again. Thanks!I ordered small, my is is 32a,25,39. The size that I ordered fits me very well. I love the panty and also the bra. They are both gorgeous. It is very comfortable to wear. They use very high end materials for this product. It has a good quality and very well made product. I look very sexy in the sexy underwear. The color is the same in the picture. The fitting is perfect to me. This is really wow. Not cheaply made.  I would love to have another color of this underwear.I\\'m a little on the heavier side, about 206 pounds and 5 8. I really have struggled with lingerie in the past. Whether it was too big, too small, or I just didn\\'t feel cute in it. I bought this for Valentine\\'s Day. When I first tried it on the cups (where the lace and cup meet) were pretty pointy. I thought that I would need to sew it or fix it somehow. I decided to wear it for a little bit to see if it relaxed more under my shirt. Thankfully, it relaxed and looked super cute. I also bought the burgundy color and it\\'s true to the picture. Exactly the color I wanted.I don\\'t think this is something I would personally wear everyday because I don\\'t like lace all that much, but it is surprisingly comfortable if you wanted to do so. I bought th 38D, which is my normal size, and it fit perfectly. It came with XXL undies, they fit like a large from Victoria\\'s Secret so I wouldn\\'t say they are a true XXL. Probably more on the XL side, at least in my experience.Overall I really love this set. I think it will wash well, and it makes me feel sexy (and that\\'s hard to do these days!). It\\'s pretty affordable for the price. I would definitely recommend!I wasn\\'t too sure about this bra and panty set, but I decided to go for it.  I\\'m pleasantly surprised!The bra is cute and fits pretty well.  I\\'m normally a 34DD so I wasn\\'t quite sure how to order because DD was not an option.  So I consulted Victoria Secret\\'s \"sister sizing\" chart to double check what the equivalent would be, and it\\'s 36D.  But I was nervous because so many reviewers said it runs small, so I ordered 36D\\'s \"sister size\" of 38C.  Whew that was a lot of numbers!The bra is CUTE!  It fits pretty well, but I\\'m wondering if I would have been better off ordering the 36D. (At this price, I might just order the smaller size anyway!)  It was NOT a push-up bra, though maybe it would be in the smaller size.  And the panties actually fit (was NOT expecting that, based on the other reviews).  The lace is pretty soft.  Basically, Wal-Mart price but not Wal-Mart quality.  And isn\\'t that the dream?I\\'m rating this a 4-star product instead of 5-stars because the shape looks kinda weird under clothes.  It\\'s lumpy and pointy.  It\\'s sexy with the shirt off, to be sure, but if you plan on surprising someone with what\\'s underneath your shirt...not so much.Looks amazing on! Was worried about sizes but went with my standard 34C, fit just right. However, highly disappointed in the quality. The night I decided to flaunt this outfit, the one bra strap snapped. With no other alternative I had to tie it off, pretty pissed about it. Looks great, feels great but doubt I’ll buy again.Cute set.  Looks good on.  I don\\'t know if this is an undergarment.  There is no boning or underwire to push the breast up if that is what you are looking for.  I like look of the set and the fit works well with my body type.It’s more swimsuit material then bra and panties.  Wife wouldn’t wear it to the pool and not comfortable for her to feel sexyDid Not Like and Will Not Purchase Again!!  I didn\\'t like the fabric or the way it looked on me.Liked it at first ! But after the first couple washes it starts to come apartgoodSays underwire push-up but mine had no wire and gave no supportNicePerfect...size ...came on time..good qualityLike how they fit and they don\\'t ride up. For anyone not sure of what size to get. I\\'m 5\\'6\", 132lbs, waist 32, hips 36. I went with the size 6 and they fit perfect. Hope that helps.I have always worn thongs .I live in Florida and I just didn\\'t like string bikini due to way the way they bunch or hang ! I thought I\\'d like to try bikini with string sides I LOVE LOVE LOVE these Panties !! They fit like a second skin they are comfortable and soft  and you never be tugging at them ..There feel great and I wear jeans .UPDATE 30 DAYS AFTER  I  picked a size to big at first they fit. I thought they would get smaller wash n drying but there a bit to big and fall down.Still Iam buying them in smaller size yes I recommend these to anyone who wants a great place to buy this style of panties The seller got them here quick I will be ordering another pak :-) I finally found a great place for panties...ladies I ordered a smaller size does I would order my NORMAL Size.I normally do not write reviews and don\\'t have the time but in order to help spread the word for this vendor, I have to say these are excellently made underwear. I have been looking for this style forever as it is most flattering on me. Not only does it fit great but they are soft and comfortable and like a previous reviewer said, you don\\'t even feel like you have them on in that they are that comfortable.I love the fit of these underwear.  I am a size 14 and the large is quite comfortable. I sometime get an XL in my bottoms to \"make sure\" they will fit me but I find myself tugging because they\\'re falling down.  I suggest you to get the size you wear, the stretch is amazing as well!!The perfect fitting cotton underwear. Doesn\\'t sit low on the hips or even too high. The side bands are comfortable and the seams are not thick. Washed great.I was leery buying site unseen, wasn\\'t sure if they\\'d end up being flimsy or as colorful as they looked.  The underwear do not disappoint.  I would highly recommend for comfort, color and price.  Ive purchased Hanes and Fruit of the Loom in the past and their colors and wear ability are not worth the price, are both of those are the same price as these Jo & Bette\\'s.I love string bikinis panties, but they are hard to find.  And not only that, once I find them, they don\\'t fit properly.  Well, I took a change with these and OMG they sooooo comfortable.  They don\\'t squeeze or pinch or bind.  The cotton is soft.  There is a lot of give. No tightness anywhere.  I will definitely be ordering more!  I love them!!These have coverage for someone with an average booty.  I\\'m not lacking, nor am I endowed, in the tush area.  The last set of skivvies I purchased show plenty of crack and slip down as I walk so I guess they were made for petite bums.  These are the same size but hold firmly in place and cover the cleft (majorly important detail) without peeking out of the waistband of my jeans.  As a bonus I\\'m pleasantly oblivious of wedgies and I can only assume that\\'s because I\\'m not getting flossed.  After several washes they\\'re holding shape and the material is still in great condition.  Usually full bottom coverage cotton undies are kind of boring, but these are cute.I purchased these shorts as an addition to my upcoming Halloween costume - I plan to be a Jack the Ripper victim at the haunted house I work at, and am putting together a flashy burlesque-y ensemble to catch the eye and stand out. I found the XL to be a perfect fit for me, though I would prefer a lower rise, as I\\'m quite short in the hip, but rolling the waist over to give a lower rise should be easy enough. I have a 39\" waist and 53\" hips, and there is plenty of room in both for a larger person, so the sizing is comfy and generous. I have problems wearing elastic on my waist, as it usually causes uncomfortable pressure and back pain, but the elastic on these is thin enough that I don\\'t have any problems. The lace ruffles are from the top of the hip bone down to the bottom, as shown in the picture, so your skirts will glide over the top part of the shorts easily, as they\\'re satin in that area. The tag is actually on the outside, not the inside, so I was momentarily confused, though this may be a fluke on my pair. I will happily purchase other colors of these shorts in the future, should I need them, as the value for the price is outstanding. The seams are sound, and the fabric is sturdy. I don\\'t have to worry about the lace itching, because it\\'s on the outside and won\\'t be touching my skin. I highly recommend these shorts if you\\'re looking for a lacy, ruffled short.I just received my pair of bloomers, and have worn them to work once. I read the reviews and decided to trust the seller\\'s measurements instead of the Amazon measurements. I have 45\" hips and a 33\" waist. I got the medium and it fits fine. Snug but fine, no wedgie etc. This pair is a tad shorter than I\\'d wanted--rests just below the cheek I suppose, and I\\'d wanted mid thigh--but this isn\\'t a problem to complain about, just be prepared. I wanted these for those days when you want a skirt but it\\'s chilly. I am satisfied.I needed something to go with a lacy top for a Leather & Lace party at a 21+ Renfair event. I absolutely love these. My only complaint is a personal preference, so I\\'m giving them a 5 star review and just putting the \\'con\\' out there to warn others with sensory issues.Pros:  - SUPER stretchy! I went for an XL because that\\'s what I bought swim bottoms in this year, and I -might- have been able to get away with the L because of how much stretch these have.  -  Cute! They definitely are adorable bloomers!  I was worried they\\'d come all scrunched looking and the lace would be sticking out in odd ways, but the were nicely folded and looked fine on.  - They have a mesh gusset for airflow. Definitely a necessity, especially in the warmer seasons.Cons  - Lace and inside of bloomers are itchy/scratchy. I hate rough/coarse fabrics and avoid them whenever possible. It\\'s a sensory thing.  The lace is really, really scratchy feeling. It\\'s not soft at all, though keep in mind lace generally isn\\'t. I could deal with this a little better if the inside was lined. While the lace isn\\'t on the inside, the stitching and fabric still lead to a distracting sensory situation in the nether parts. Even a super thin lining of a software/sleeker material would be helpful here. Thankfully, I do have black boy short style undies, which will help mitigate some of the sensation. Definitely don\\'t expect to wear only these if you have are particular about fabrics.very cute, comfortable and well made. However, when worn under any of my dresses they make my butt look lumpy from the ruffles. Would work best for a ruffled or layered dress, or one that has a petticoat under it. Not for regular sundresses or skater skirts that hang close to the skin.It definitely goes up high, I folded the waist down, but you can tell from the picture that its high waisted. It fit just fine and did what I wanted it to do. Cute red ruffles and no problems with wedgies or anything. It was comfortable.Steampunk is the  wrong genre to call this amazing find. This style has been around since My Dolls era 1970,early and the awesome genre of trashy Glam punk still rocks after Chinese Rock and the void generation. Love them! A must to restock this gem of antifashion.excellent item!!! Worked great as part of a Halloween costume. Cute and very comfortable. They run small so I knew to order bigger than my size. I actually went 2 sizes up and they were perfect.I love these.  They are the perfect inseam:  Not too long and dowdy, not too short and uncomfortable.  They are GREAT.  They are super high-waisted (above the belly-button), but I usually just alter them with my serger and I am good to go.At first, I was nervous that these would be horrible. After three kids, my hips and butt are just not built for sexy underwear. HOWEVER, they fit and feel great!!! The biggest issue I\\'ve had in the past was after moving around, I\\'d get a wedgie! My ass would just suck it right up! But these stay put, just like they should! They\\'re comfortable and make my husband smile when he sees me wearing them! I intend to buy more!!UPDATE: it’s been 14 months since my purchase and the underwear does not last. The fabric has tightened and has lost its stretch. I usually buy victoria’s Secret and I will be returning to that brand since my underwear usually lasts years.FIRST REVIEW: These are sooo comfortable and my favorite undies! They\\'re cute, attractive and functional. You can\\'t see them underneath clothes because they hug the body but not too tight, no muffin top! I\\'m reviewing this now because I\\'m ordering more, highly recommend. Fits as expected.These underwear are cute, and are a little small and snug but that was okay. I bought the Large because I am a Womens size 10 pant size. Material is very soft. However when I washed the underwear in the machine for the first time on the delicate setting in cool water, I noticed that the lace was already starting to show some wear. There are also a number of loose threads and the bows on a few pairs have come undone and the ends of the ribbons of the bows are already starting to fray. Mind you this is all from ONE wash - I decided to hang dry them to avoid further damage. They\\'re cute, and I think the underwear overall will last, but the details definitely wont. If you get these wash them by hand (or in a lingerie bag) and air dry.UPDATE: Ok they are MUCH worse than I originally thought. Washed them for the second time last night and the lace on a few of the pairs is already almost completely frayed. The quality seems inconsistent for each pair - some are fine, others are starting to look like a disaster only two washes later. I would not recommend buying these underwear for their cute factor.Really disappointed in the quality. They frayed before I even got my pants on the first time I wore them. Only one pair held up through the wash.After reading the reviews I ordered a large instead of medium and they fit great!  They are super soft and comfortable.  I can barely tell I am wearing them.  They are low in the back, so they might not be comfortable if you have a big booty. I would but again!These are my favorite cheeky panties I\\'ve ever bought. I got Victoria\\'s Secret panties for years but didn\\'t like the price and how quickly they fell apart so I ordered these after reading reviews. Love love love them. They\\'re cute and feminine - definitely not granny panties. They fit perfectly and are so comfy I\\'m not even aware they\\'re on. The colors are a perfect assortment. I ordered X-large since I have big hips I\\'m 5.7 and 170 pounds and X-large fits perfectly.Pros:-Cute style-Vibrant colors-Lace is soft, not itchy or scratchyCons:-Very cheap materials-The lace has no give. Since the lace runs along the seams of the panties, this means the panties themselves have no give.-runs small-Low back. I have no butt, so nothing shows, but if I didnt have a flat butt my crack would definitely be peaking outOverall: good cheap panties. They\\'re definitely not the worst. But, for the same price you can get 5 pairs of panties from Target that are much better quality than these. Not worth the price when comparing to store prices.I\\'m 5ft 4 and wear a size 10 in jeans. The medium for great. They\\'ve been through the washer and dryer once and came out fine. They stay put throughout the day. You can\\'t see them through pants shorts but you will probably need a slip of you\\'re wearing a dress of thinner material to block panty lines. I would buy againI have never liked thongs until I tried these. I\\'m bottom heavy, wear a size 10-12 curvy cut jeans, and ordered an XL.I started doing karate a few months ago. Every class, my standard hipster or boycut underwear would ride up to where the sun doesn\\'t shine and give me the wedgie to end all wedgies. Not cool. Not comfortable.I decided that the solution would be to wear a thong. I prefer cotton underwear over other stuff. These happened to be cotton. So I decided to give them a try.First karate class while wearing one was a fantastic, wedgie free experience. I was impressed! I tried them with jeans. Life was good! I\\'m even wearing one today. Consider me converted.This is my 2nd time offering. I first ordered the plain without lines and loved them so much I bought the lined. 5\\'5, 185lbs with wide hips and junk in the trunk and CO fits amazingly, even after wash/dry and they\\'ve held up great this far.  These do not cut into my hips,  they fit so comfortably,  even when hiking and working out.These are the best, most comfortable underwear I\\'ve ever gotten in my entire life. The fabric is thick, soft, and barely noticeable when worn. I could tell from the moment these arrived that they were perfect. From the beautiful zipper bag in which these were carefully packed, to the luxurious feel of the cloth, I was so happy to finally have found such a quality item. I\\'ve used underwear from VS to Wal-Mart, and everything in between, and I will never use any other brand than these I just got on Amazon. Super happy and extremely impressed!I love these because it\\'s hard to find cotton thongs and these are 95%. I can tell the difference! They\\'re a bit low rise for my taste. I might have sized up to fix that, but I\\'m normally a small, and they\\'re not uncomfortable. The V is nice and wide, and I\\'m tall so sometimes I have the issue of the back riding up the front if the front isn\\'t wide enough. The back isn\\'t too thick or uncomfy, either. I washed them before wearing (I hope everyone does lol), and they may have shrunk a little bit. I have super small hips so maybe that\\'s better. I\\'ve washed a couple pairs a second time now, and they haven\\'t fallen apart, but do have some strings where the sides are sewn. I\\'d buy more! Better than expected for the price.Very comfortable.I\\'m 115lb and ordered size M.Wow! Great buy. I hate paying so much money for one or two pairs of underwear. These are nice and soft and fit extremely well.Seriously I\\'m reviewing undies from Amazon??Perfect fit as I had hoped and here\\'s why:Love the combination of cotton and spandex - kept shape after wash and feels great! Very soft. I\\'m talking these are comfey. Everywhere.Not too skimpy, and not too much. Just the right amount of material width on hips.Well made and good quality - so surprised because I mean look at the price... The colors are bright and deep too. Very pretty.So yes! The price is amazing!! I can not emphasize this enough for what I received for a package of this many.And a true test again - they washed up FANTASTIC - kept shape, and feel GREAT.Tag is small and on the side - not in the way!!I bought a package of each - with the bow/deco lines, and one plain. The only difference is the decoration bow and black bead line.A giant leap to buy undies on Amazon - I buy almost everything else but I never thought... But I went for it and am so glad I did. As a gal I had to write this review. I appreciate honest reviews because they help me.I\\'m 5\\'4 105lbs and took the small. They are perfect.Great product, great price. I would love to be able to get organic cotton thongs for this price! These fit true to size, I am a size 6 in pants or a 29 in jeans, and I ordered the medium. They are perfect. Not too high, not too low. Soft, not too tight. I have not washed them yet. The only thing I might change, is to have a little less material going up your butt. Just a slightly skinnier thong part, but the sides are great because they are wide and won\\'t cause too much panty line.I decided to buy these match the Mae coral padded bralette (also purchased on amazon).  I originally purchased these panties in the medium size, and they were too snug, so I exchanged them for the large.  While the large size was more flattering, they tended to ride up my bum.  Guess these are just not my style.  Otherwise, they are beautiful.  I like the lace.  I like the colors.  I like the soft material.  Hope you have better luck!Reference: I am 39 yo, 5\"4\\', 130 lbs. I have an athletic build with bigger-than-average thighs/bum/shoulders with a smaller waist. I usually wear size small shirt, size 6/8 pant, a size small dress (or size 4/6), 8.0 W or 8.5 M shoe, and a 34B bra.ahhh, median line seam camel toe.... how i hate thee.why do fashion houses insist on putting a seam straight down the middle of underwear for women? you cannot possibly tell me you save THAT much money on materials doing it that way.overall they\\'re nice, but i wont buy more, i\\'m not into camel toe.Disappointing. Lace is cheap, slick, and rolls easily. I ordered the set described as Navy/White/Grey, but they are Purple/Ivory/Toupe-Grey.These are pretty and comfortable. They fit as per the size chart.I absolutely love these! The colors are so pretty and true to picture. I will definitely be buying the other colors. I got a large and I am a 41\" waist.These fit great, just as I expected. Definitely cheeky, which is what I was looking for. They fit true to size and I love the colors. I haven\\'t experienced any of the discomfort/camel toe/riding up issues that other reviewers noted, however I would say that if you aren\\'t familiar with cheeky style panties you may find them uncomfortable (they\\'re not for everyone) and I wouldn\\'t suggest a lace three pack as a first try.I got a few different colors and thinking about getting more. They fit well and are comfortable to wear. Good quality, too. They look and feel like some of my other brand pairs that I paid 3 times more for.One of three pairs unraveled as I tried them on for the first time. Not wearable will have to return defective panties.Love this (husband did too)! Fits so well, covers all the right places, exposes all the right places. Very comfortable.These were as expected for price.  Run a bit smallFit a little smaller than expected. The material is also kind of itchy especially around the waist bandOnly giving it 3 stars due to the sizes received were extremely too small for a women who was size 12. Normally a large is fine, it was an epic failure, and the extra large took some work to fit but then was comfortable after a while. They are extremely cute and accessible front and back, but they just run really small.Love, very softNiceGoodI normally wear a medium to a large in underwear. I weigh around 130 and wear around 7-9 in pants. So I ordered an XL in these and it fit perfect! Looks exactly like the picture. I\\'d definitely buy again in another color.I debated between the cotton and poly seamless ones and everyone raves about the cotton and says the seamless ones are terrible. The cotton don’t run big like the reviewers said and they don’t shrink or hug nicely even after washing. I wish I trusted my gut and got the seamless non cotton pack instead.First of all I wear size 5 or small in women panties. There is no stretch to material as described. It\\'s shame that I will not be able to wear them. I love the colors and softness of material. I don\\'t like that there is a tag on the sides (not comfortable). The waist band has thick seams all the way around. Seams can be seen through tight leggings.Good fit and very soft. No elastic at all so they are just like tshirts. Once you wear them for a bit, they fall down. One of the benefits of thong panties is that you dont have to mess with them. You have to pull these up a dozen times a day.Although they\\'re not completely cotton, they\\'re very soft on your skin. They make it feel like you\\'re not wearing any underwear but also provide the support you need when you\\'re wearing them.The best underwear I’ve ever purchased! So comfortable...great material...invisible under clothes. I’m ordering more!Undoubtedly the softest thongs. Perfect placement to cover abdomino plasty incision line. Very comfortable. Maybe size up, though.These are just perfect- soft, comfy, cut to the right shape. Very pleased!Soft material and doesn\\'t ride up so I lived themWhen I ordered them, I expected crouchless because that\\'s what it said. They weren\\'t. That being said they are still pretty. I will keep, but am not happy. I don\\'t ever write bad reviews unless absolutely unhappy. I gave a 3 star because panties are pretty and soft. Just not what I wanted.Super cute and sexy. Nice and soft materials. Runs large. I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you. Just didn’t work for my post partum body.First of all, thank you to the company for listing a chart with their sizes in relationship to woman\\'s jean sizes. 🙌 Because let\\'s be honest, I\\'m not going to measure myself, but especially not to buy just underwear. So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front \\'area\\'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: \"Well I didn\\'t have to take these off, which I like, so more\" (He\\'s not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉Super stretchy material. I love these. Try aren\\'t the most amazing thick quality but they will work for the price.These were so sexy and I looked hot in them. I do not wear a 3X, but because they stretch I got a larger size than what I believed I wore. It fit perfectly.I went off other reviews on how they run for size and everything I read said they run small so I ordered a size larger and they are definitely larger.  They weren\\'t too large to go through the effort of returning them but would have been sexier if the fit was better.Bought for my nieces bridal shower . I think she’s going to love them ! It’s for a pantie game they’re playingThese are exactly as pictured. The XL size is a little bit on the snug side but not bad.They are very comfortable. Sometimes you want a high waisted underwear.I know I prefer that when I wear higher waisted pants or skirts, it just feels better to me. These are breathable and are soft. The colors are nice too. They fit pretty true to size for me.I’m a fan of the “cheeky” undies. These have a great design, that shows just enough cheek, but is comfortable as well. They have good stretch (a bit small, but good motivation!) and the cotton panel makes them breathable.This review is for the Multi-color 6pcs size small. These bikinis hugs low on the hips. I’m usually a x-small and small fits me, so I would recommend that you go up a size or two or follow the chart for sizing.Love the underwear very nice style. But I wish I would have ordered a size bigger. I already ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear. I guess I\\'ll just lose a couple poundsThese undies are sooo cute!! They did come a little small for a size smal (BUT NOT TOO SMALL) just fit a little snug - no muffin top or anything. I love the see through lace 😏😏😏😏These are truly sexy and very comfortable! Arrived packaged well, each underwear is individually packed which I like very much. Seems very durable and nice material!These panties are pretty and fit as described. The designs are gorgeous and the material is breathable. Highly recommended.it is definitely sized wrong I wear a medium and these are almost extra smallI normally wouldn\\'t write a review for underwear, but I absolutely had to for these! I have tried 2 or 3 different kinds from Amazon, (since I gave up on VS due to quality and $$) but couldnt find any I really loved. Then I came across Mae. I am so happy with this purchase I am buying more! 95% cotton (truly), and the lace is SO soft!!! I am usually a M in VS thongs, but I ended up getting a large and they fit perfectly! I\\'m 5\\'7, 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 in jeans. The quality of these is AMAZING and I dont feel like the lace is going to rip after a week lol! If you are sick of VS and like cotton, hello Mae!!!!👍😍I\\'m normally a US size 6 or medium. I went ahead and sized up just in case and wound up with 3 different sizes. No, they weren\\'t labeled as such. The trim of the width and length of the \"crotch area\" varied in every pair, and the waist band on one out of 3 was much looser than the other 2.  One pair, fits perfectly.I really like the material and the style though, so I\\'m going to order a size medium next and see if I have better luck.Will update.UPDATE: Love these in a medium. They are very delicate but stretchy and flattering. Don\\'t SIZE UP! They\\'re true to American sizes and stretchy enough to be a little forgiving if you\\'re between sizes.Very nice thongs.  Have a very large underwear collection (BoutineLA, WT, VS) but these have definitely earned their way into the regular rotation.Not sure how durable the lace waistband is, but they’ve made it a few washes with no problems.Will probably end up buying more in different colors.Just received these today. Was tired of paying a ridiculous amount for nicer name-brand panties, or cheaping out on uncomfortable inexpensive ones. Best part is these guys actually fit. A lot of thongs I tend to buy in my supposed size rise up so high I feel like I should be in Baywatch (which isn\\'t always bad, but they\\'re never the right cut to compliment that.), lol. The actual cotton panty part sits low enough to compliment the stretchy lace band while not sitting ridiculously high on my hips. Will definitely be looking at more of your products again, thanks!Very comfortable. No-show under leggings. And COTTON (except for the lace) which is so hard to find. I am buying more. Recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. I am a size 10 and got these in large. They fit perfectly but if they stretch out AT ALL over time they will be too big. I may try a MI have several thongs that are a similar style from other stores, so when I saw these at a great price, I figured I didn\\'t have anything to lose! And I was right! I generally wear medium size underwear, and I ordered a medium, and the fit is excellent! The only reason I\\'m not giving five stars is because the elastic in the black pair started to fray after a couple washes. Not a deal breaker, and no one will notice but me, but still not quite five-star quality. Definitely worth the price!Fit is fine and they wash up nice...air dryThese are cute and just as described but they run quite small. I\\'d recommend order 1 to 2 sizes up depending on your shape. I ordered these in large based on reviews stating they run small and I compared them to my Victoria Secret size medium underwear of the same style (cotton crotch, lace top) and the large is still smaller than the VS medium!They are cheap material and are very small. I ordered 3 for me and my friends because they say one size fits all so I figured they were stretchy but they don’t stretch and I’m a size 4 jeans and they are uncomfortably small. Could definitely cause a yeast infection!I normally wear a 6 or 7 in other brands.  I am 5\\'6 145 lbs, athletic but not curvy so I ordered the Large.  The quality is not bad, but they were very small for me.  I would need at least an XL.  And the front panel is cut very low and skimpy.  Sending them back.Fit is okay. I just wish I looked into the description better. These have an elastic band along the top which I don\\'t care for at all and they sit a lot higher than I\\'m used to (I must buy low rise normally) and frequently show above some of my pants.Different materials used for different colors. The nice soft stretchy material is great. The thick woven cotton sucks and can be seen on all clothes. They are a bit smaller, so if your used to a medium at VS then these pinch. Nice construction but ouch.I had ordered a large, package said large, but goofy me washed them and noticed I received small. Like the looks and quality. Just check the size when you get them. I would  return the undies  but since I washed them.....would have given them a 5.These seem a little small for me as I am 4\\'11\" and 98lbs. However, I am a little hippie so that could be why they are a little tight. I ordered the small and next time I will get the mediums. They seem well made and are very cute for sure.Some colors not as described. Some fit good, others too tightGood fit looks greatToo small....The quality was good but the sizes were not accurate at all.....returned.I like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitHalf of these aren\\'t the color they show. The solid pink are gold shimmer(my husband asked if i was going wrestling lol) and the solid blue are shimmer as well.Love these! So cute, silky soft, and they make your butt look fabulous. Small was true to size. I wish they had more pinks and blacks rather than the blue colors, but that’s just personal preference. The quality is great for the price, these are comfy but still sexy.The item I received looks nothing like what\\'s pictured and described in the listing.  What I received looks more like a thong.  Fortunately, the items were easy to return.  Hopefully the refund, will come quickly.Instant wedgie with first few steps taken, hate them.CuteGreat product. Bought for a trip and they’re what I needed.Purchased for my daughter, she likes the color. The color is cute and she wished they can come up with more colors. Will definitely buy more products from this brand.I like them very good quality my wife will love themI love these! Size chart was correct, my hips are 53” and I ordered 3xl. Extremely comfortable and breathable, and they\\'re very flattering. I would definitely order again! It\\'s so hard to find comfy thongs to fit my hips but these did the job, and the front is like a regular panty so you wont have any uncomfortable Victoria Secret thong feels.I am not a thong person. In fact 0 interest, but I would like to be sexy from time to time for my spouse. These are the most comfortable, barely there, softest thongs I have ever tried! I wore them all day last weekend and never once felt uncomfortable!I am 5\\'7\" 220lbs. Xxl fits me perfect. Soft fabric and lace. Good quality. I just got them today and Im going to order more right now.These are very cute but they have very little stretch. I should have exchanged them for a larger size, but I\\'ve already run them through the wash. Technically, they\\'re not seamless. I was hoping to have something less clunky to wear to help with bikini line rash, but I don\\'t think these are the ones. They\\'re also somewhat high-waisted, so be prepared for that. Otherwise, they\\'re undies. They\\'re doing their basic job.These came in the mail very quickly, I read some reviews and decided to order up one size and they fit beautifully! And there is a lot of from coverage and an all around nice feel and cut to them. The pictures really don’t do them justice, they are beautiful in person and amazingly soft.Even though they\\'re a tab bit large it\\'s made up for in comfort! My goodness are these comfortable! I feel sexy and comfortable at the same time!True to size and comfortableI am a size 20, carry my weight in the stomach area, ordered a 3x. These are super comfy and flattering.  I would purchase them again!I am about 7/8 in pants & 6 or 8 in a dress. I have hips, butt & do not have a toned stomach. Most shaper\\'s, push skin/fat outside the shaper & do not flatter your shape. And some never stay on your belly = roll down. This product was on sale so I decided to try it. I was really surprised that the shaper did not roll down, kept my stomach flat, fit well & comfortable. Highly recommend.Works pretty good but the boning occasionally digs in.  Still, worth a momentary discomfort and adjustment for the support. Amazing how much my jeans slide down my waist wearing this, just a little redistribution of skin makes a huge difference in how you look in those pants!I posted a photo showing this shaper thong size XL with a Victoria\\'s Secret size M thong.It is fantastic, am buying another but in a L. Which is going down a size from this purchase.I wear 29 jeans, M or L in VS.I ordered  S. I am 5\\'8 140lb. pant size 2. I really love it.It\\'s a little too big on me, but overall I\\'m happy with the purchase.Love these bottoms. Even got a pair for the other girl I work with. And the top it so high waisted greatto cover the bellyI thought this might help modify my waist but the top rolls down.  Built well but I need a larger size.fit is true to size, it comes up to high making my fat come out under my breast area if that makes sense. But It does flatten my tummy area.I really like this! the quality is great (esp. considering it was only like $9 with tax). I\\'m usually a small or medium on top and a large/XL on the bottom. i think my waist is like 32 in and my hips are around 44in and i wear anywhere between an 8 to a 12 in pants but often the waist is loose. Anyway, I got a large in these even tho they said its for waist sizes up to a 28.5 because i wanted it to shape me. It\\'s the perfect tightness, it gives me a nice shape but its not so tight that it would be uncomfortable.I wanted to love these so badly, but the top keeps rolling just like I’ve read with all the other reviews. I thought it wouldn’t bother me, but it does!! Unfortunately!  Anytime you wear these with a real fitted dress or tights, since it rolls over, it actually shows more of your  Love handles ! Lol  when you raise them, then it bothers your other end… If you know what I mean!These cut off in weird places.  I just wanted to get rid of panty lines but instead it gave me buldges in new places. :(  I wore these under a dress to a wedding.  By the time the toasts came the thong part had ridden up and was cutting into me. So basically these are comfortable if you just plan to lay around the house all day.I’m not one to wear girdles whether I need them or not they always end up in my purse by the end of the night lol. But, I tried again with these and they’re perfect for a little “touch up” in the lower belly area! I have wide hips and big butt and legs usually the long short high waisted girdles ride up the leg and down the waist. These eliminate that and just hold in the belly area. Very nice.I took a chance on this, even though previous reviews said they had problems with rolling... I wore it under a bodycon dress and it fit like a dream. Flattened and held everything together nicely without being too rigid. I have other undergarments that come up higher and are more rigid and I bought this one specifically b/c I didn\\'t need it to come up as high b/c part of the dress was see through, so the top of the stomach needed to show. Maybe it\\'s that you have to make sure you get and accurate size. Idk. 180lbs. 5\\'3 xl fit me perfectly.*Update- nevermind it rolls down a lot. The waistband got loose and never retained it\\'s tightness againSo you have to size up. I wear US women\\'s 10 and purchased an XXL and they just barely fit. It has moderate tummy control and a high waist so it helps smooth things out but not completely. I have a c-section \"shelf\" so I need high tummy control to make it flat, but most of these types of products are terribly uncomfortable. This panty is comfortable enough for every day use. My only complaint is that it not completely smooth so you have some high thong panty lines in tight dresses.The thong was the only thing I liked about it. Its not a waist cincher it rolls non stop very disappointedim slim thick so this is such a great buy for when i eat and look somewhat pregnant ;) it will cover it very nicely. it does roll down somewhat but not terribly bad like i have experienced with simliar products.I typically like the men\\'s cuts better (more room up front), but I couldn\\'t find a nice silk/satin string bikini for men. This is a nice product as it is indeed partially silk. The only stretch comes from the elastic as the main fabric has no stretch. I am typically a mens medium which most of the time equates to a womens large. I ordered the extra large and initially received an item with a tag sized medium. This was crazy small, so I contacted the seller and they sent me the item with XL on the tag. The XL fits great! There is enough room up front for most men if you are curious. The back is mostly full coverage, but due to the lack of stretchiness in the fabric, riding up does occur. Nice product once you get the correct size!I really like these, but it\\'s worth noting that sizing up once is not enough. I have 44 inch hips and ordered the XXL which is supposed to fit an XL. They fit me like a size Medium in most women\\'s clothes- tight and dig into my hips. Other than sizing they\\'re great. The little bows are glued on, but they were cheap so that\\'s about the quality I expected.  The fabric is soft, but the bikini straps are rough. I wish there was a XXXL- I\\'d order so many of these!I like the product but it is obviously way too small so you have to order up a size or two and then you don\\'t exactly know what you\\'re getting. We went two sizes up and they fit okay. A little big but the size up would have been too tight..Also, the purple is more of a soft soft lavender. Depending on the wife\\'s thoughts, we may or may not get another color.I do like them but I had to return them because I don\\'t have a big bootie and you need bootie to fill these out . From the front they are very cute. From the back, if you are like me, it looks like diapers. But I did purchase a different style from the same company, in the same fancy silk and I love those.It\\'s such a shame since they appear to be well made and soft fabric.  From my other order of a similar (or the same?) product, it\\'s almost as if the tags go randomly.  You probably have a 50/50 chance of getting the correct size.  Good luck!I washed them with detergent and vinegar. Still smelled of mildew. Then I dried them on a radiator, hoping the heat would kill the mildew. I ordered 4 pairs. 3 of 4 smelled better. 1 did not, so I threw that one away.Loved them and so did my mate!  Fit as expected and felt amazingOrdered a beige that, according to the pictures on the amazon beige, looks much lighter than the one I received. To me the one I received looks more like brown. The silk is otherwise of great quality. Size is accurate. I wear a 34 and the size S (M) fits perfectlyHappy wife, happy Life:-) Here\\'s her thoughtsThese are quite comfy and really turn my man on. Here\\'s what I like:Pros:  Comfy  Great colors  Access hole is very big  Nice lace for the priceAnd here\\'s what I don\\'t like:Cons:  easy to rip or snag  Rolls up if you have a tummyI\\'m a plus sized lady so finding fun sexy clothing can sometimes be a little challenging, but he got it right with these:-) I love teasing him when we\\'re at the store shopping and I\\'ve got on my sundress or when he gets the car door for me and I get in/out side saddle giving him an \"eye-full\" :-)Needless to say we\\'re both quite happy:-)Super sexy and fit as expected. However, for being \"crotchless\" they covered a good deal of \"crotch\". With a pair of seam rippers, I made necessary adjustments, but I wish they were a little more practical for \\'rushed encounters\\'.AMAZINGThese are great.  Just order a size or two up.  I usually wear L/XL but ordered a six XL a little too big but wearable.  Really like them.Quedo prefectoGreat. Exactly as shown. Fit as expected. Really liked these.Great buy. The only thing is the ruffle seems to fit in the front which kind of looks weird but still looks sexy!Set was nothing like the picture at all. The top was comically small, and the panties were too big. Don\\'t bother with this item.Well, don’t expect this to come complete. This set is more like a DIY... stitch it yourself... type thing.I received this set and the bra portion of it had 6 unsewn straps and the only straps that were sewn had major overhang.The panties were sewn without paying attention to the direction, so they twist when put on. The cloth portion was somehow sewn at an angle. I have no idea. I’ve worn tons of lingerie and know I don’t have any crazy deformity with my hips... so....Overall, this thing was a fail. And I’d refrain from wasting money.It wasn’t too bad to be honest. I ordered an XXL when I’m usually an L in this kind of stuff, and it fit just a little snug. The straps aren’t as this as it shows in the photo and it’s not really adjustable. Also, gives zero support, but I wasn’t really expecting that in the first place.Overall, I’d say it’s actually pretty good for the price. I mean, four dollars? I’m satisfied, and glad I tried it.Side note, it also came earlier than was expected.This is nothing like the picture. The bottles r too big and if u r a size D breast the top is a joke. It literally looks like a top for an A cupI\\'m a bit fluffy so finding something that looks good on me is challenging. This fits nice and moves with me as it\\'s made out of only elastic. Love it and I feel super sexy in it!This pleasantly surprised me. Fit was on point. It looks nice on. Definitely worth the money.The top looks absolutely loathing like the photo and barely covers my nips even tho I’m only a B cup, so frustratingThis is way beyond cheap looking and the top was too big my boobs didn\\'t fill it out lol..should\\'ve known better!So I bought this body shaper for a special event coming up. It arrived in great condition, well-packed and all that. I tried it on for size - all good. It snugs in at all the right places, and does not feel like it is rolling up/ down while at the same time I can breathe. There\\'s just one small problem that I can foresee... there\\'s no crotch opening. I will be wearing a dress and a crinoline with this. I\\'m trying to imagine being in a tiny stall in a public restroom trying to wrestle this thing down past all that AND worse still, back up. The event is eight hours long, so it will be an interesting time. I\\'m giving it a go because it really does a good job at shaping which is its primary function. However, I would ask the manufacturer to have a heart. Once you have all that spandex situated just so, you sure don\\'t want to have to do it over and over again. Let\\'s face it, most women will reserve this type of undergarment for special occasions where she is already putting up with heels, netting, slips, static cling, push-up bras, and heaven forbid hosiery. The least manufacturers can do is make going to the bathroom an activity that doesn\\'t require two lady\\'s maids and a crowbar.This is my first time buying anything like this so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does what it\\'s supposed to! It\\'s not some huge crazy body transformation but it pulls everything in enough to make me feel less self conscious. I had a baby and didn\\'t loose as much weight for my best friends wedding as I would have hoped and these did a good job of pulling things in some, giving me. Some shape back and smoothing out the busted can of buscuits look! I definitely recommend!!For. Sizing I\\'m a 16 dress size, xl or 17-18 pants right now and I got the 2xl in shape wear and they fit perfectly!I was looking for a little help controlling my belly after pregnancy. This definitely does the job. It\\'s worth the price.i have tried countless shapewear from Spanx to every other brand sold at every single department store. i knew this one was amazing before even trying it on, just by taking it out of the package. the material is incredibly breathable and comfortable, the boning is just enough to where it\\'s not obnoxiously obvious or uncomfortable. i don\\'t feel like stuffed sausage and everything is very smooth, even on the thighs where the shapewear starts. seriously, the best shapewear i\\'ve ever, ever tried. and for the price, it\\'s unbeatable. the sizing is the only thing to be observant about. i\\'m a solid size 10, 170 lbs and ordered the 2x and it was perfect. sooo happy!I am 5’ 7” and weigh140 lbs.  I ordered the Large/X Large and it fit exactly as I expected.  It is snug, but the way I would want it to be.  I purchased it to wear beneath my somewhat tight-fitting dresses and it is perfect!  The legs did not roll, and it was easy enough to pull down and back up for bathroom breaks.  I am glad it has the boning in front and back - that ensures the torso portion will stay in place.  I did not notice the boning when dressed.  I think it’s a great product!I am 200 something pounds and Omg this thing is awesome it helps with keeping stuff together the leg part is kind of tight so I wouldn\\'t want to wear any leggings  cuz you could see the line but everything else is perfect it\\'s perfect for a dressThe sizing seems to be accurate and it fit ok.  Tight enough to support without being uncomfortable.  While I was able to pull the garment up all the way, the bands around my thighs were very tight and dug into the flesh causing an indention that showed through leggings and pants.  Would probably be ok with a dress but still dug in.  I tried on a pair of black slacks with this on and while the pants were not tight, you could definitely see where the bands were around my thighs.  Looked awful.  I am 5\\'6\" and 165 lbs.  Curvy.  Pear shaped.  Would not recommend to anyone who has \"fleshy\" thighs.  I measured my thigh where the band was and my thigh is 21 inches around (about 7-8 inches down from my crotch).  I had ordered a size L/XL.  I am returning.Fits as expected but cant be worn over form fitting clothes. It has boning in the front and back and you could see it through the dress I wanted to wear it under.Metallic shine is nice and rare in string bikini cut. Model had no compaints and kept them after shoot.I have been looking for panties like these for a while where they have the shiny look of satin but have a little stretch to them.  They fit great and feel great.  For a guy who wears panties these will work well for you as they have enough stretch to comfortably accommodate a guy.  The only things I have to say negatively is that the back bikini part is narrower than I like and the shipping will take every bit of the estimate.  Mine were three days late.  I am not big about ordering these items that come from China, as they take solo long, but it was the only place I could find what I was looking for.  Thanks!These are nice. The backside is cut kind of narrow and doesn\\'t cover all of my butt, and I really don\\'t have 1 to begin with. They are smooth and well made and feel very nice on. They aren\\'t the satin panties from the 80\\'s and early 90\\'s, or the Joe Boxer kind, but they are still REALLY nice.I love these panties! This is actually the second set that I’ve purchased. They’re extremely comfortable and well made. I purchased like satin panties from a competitor and paid $90 for a set of four.My only complaint is that they don’t have more colors, I’d love to see a black or navy.130lbs curvy-size Medium fits great-love the look but I reallllly doubt these are satin as advertised-still love them thoughI\\'ve been developing a larger booty over the last two years, so my cheeks stick out a bit too much, from these panties. I still like them, however, and find them to be soft and very pretty! :)they r the best I have found in quite awhile,wish they had more stock availiable,good bunch of people thou, they r greatFit as described! Material a little cheaper than thought, but for price they are good. Quick delivery!I\\'m very surprised with this item! As someone with a smaller chest I usually worry about looking to flat but this bra fits awesome.  The underwire gives a lot of support and it looks just like the pictureI am 135 lb and 5’5” (10 pounds overweight)—small breasts and big rear. The medium fit on the tightest notch top and bottom. I could have used the small but was wanting  to wear it a couple days after purchasing so kept the medium. It covered my belly (problem area) and was flattering to my small breasts. The garters are really hot. My husband would give it more than 5 stars if he could! It was a great anniversary gift for him. ;)I purchased this for a Bachelorette party. The girl feel between a small and medium per the chart. I purchased the medium and she liked it much better. She didn\\'t want everything hanging out. Loved the red color and was very softThis is very sexy and really comfortable--You can sleep in this!I can’t even explain how good I feel in this!! I have tried so many different types of lingerie to try and feel sexy, but I could never find that perfect one! Until now! It fits amazing! It makes me feel so sexy and comfortable! I can’t wait until my man sees this! I would give this so many more stars if it was possible! Highly recommend!! I will be buying from this company in the future!Love itSexy as hellFabric is awesome. Good quality, soft and stretchy, fits well.A little cheaply made, but good for the money.Wife was very pleased.  Said fit as expected and nice padding.  The frilly part is hidden enough to he an everyday thing she could wear.  Price very reasonable.- the panties are quite small considering that.Actual color is quite more saturated than the depiction.Nice feel to the material, very sexy bra.This was good quality. It looks good on, fits well. The panties actually fit! And they\\'re nice.Great. fits good & is exactly as advertised.Me and my girlfriend love it on herThe description of product was dead on .. the bra fits perfectlyThe pantys was two small but the bra fit just wrightThese are now my go to underwear ! Absolutely superior fit ! I\\'ve not had the best luck with laser cut in the past, with them moving all over or riding up say in jeans, but these are awesome! They are hemmed over and hug your body and don\\'t move! The material is a bit thicker and very stretchy and gives a very smooth look! Very excited and pleased with COSOMALL !  I will be buying more!Barely there!! They feel great! Perfect fit and love the color selections!  I am 5\\'8 about a size 9 in pants about 165lbs and the Large fit great! Not snug at all and just fit right. Would buy again!I normally order a medium in just about everything.  The reviews for this product said order size up.  So, I ordered large.  The waist is ever so slightly too loose.  The leg openings, oddly, are slightly too snug.  These panties come beautifully pressed and flat, washing instructions suggest hand wash and hang dry.  These panties were reasonably priced.  I machine wash on cold and hang dry (when I remember they are in a load!). They are VERY comfortable, smooth and silky feeling.  I am 5-6\" 138 lbs.  I am not small waisted and do not have large hips.  I would buy this product again.These are great! Fit well, nice material, sexy cut. I’m 5’7” 265lbs size 20 jeans and the XXL fits great.Well-constructed...nice material and fits as expected...love it!These fit somewhat big on my upper butt, but I expected that from the reviews. They are still very comfortable underwear, and do not show any lines under tight leggings so I am happy! They are definitely worth the money and the colors are quite vibrant. Despite washing them when I go them, the first time I wore each pair, quite a bit of color transferred to my skin.  The colors still look good though. Some reviews made me think I might need a larger size, but I\\'m 5\\'8\" and 210lbs and my XLs are definitely not too tight.I am disappointed because I really wanted to like these underwear.  I have had trouble with laser cut in the past and some ripping, but I thought the folded edge on these would solve that issue while still being invisible under pants.  They are a very soft material, which I was excited for.  I typically wear a size 0, so I ordered both an x-small and small.  Unfortunately, both were too tight in the butt area and dug into my skin, which would be obvious under pants.  I returned them and debated whether or not to try a medium, thinking they would definitely be too big.  I decided to try anyway and they were, in fact, too large.  I\\'m sure if you\\'re the right size, these would be a great purchase.  However, I am not.My wife seems to like it and I like it on her :) The price and quality is  fair.  I think Victoria Secret shoppers would envy this deal when they find out you can get 5 more pieces for  a single  lingerie at their store.I wear a 12/L, ordered this in a large - fits perfect.  Needed something to keep the girls in place during fun time.  The bottoms are the problem.  They fit, but they are not crotchless.Its alright. It\\'s something different and kind of fun but nothing exceptional.  The panties chafe a bit between your legs and you have to readjust the straps there. The bra fit nice but I was disappointed in how I had to arrange my breasts all the time to keep them from covering the bra completely. It\\'s a nice way to see if you want to spend the money on a good set because this thing is more for fun.Soft lace and good stretch. Great fit, I’m 5’3 120 34c. Very sexy and fun. Good quality. Love the purple and black together very beautiful set.SexyIt fit very nicelyGood fit.I ordered these because I liked the lacy look in the front.The lace is pretty and feminine, which is unusual in control type panties and my husband likes them better than my usual panties.They are very pretty and would be extremely comfortable if I had ordered a size larger.Too small and non flattering. Cheap as well. Waste of money because I can’t weer them and can’t return underwearI like them a lot they fit perfectly I love the material definitely buying them againWay to small! I purchased the recommended size, and I will never wear them.I wear a size 7 normally so ordered the XL (largest size offered at the time) and they fit very snug.  Guess you can\\'t have a booty or they will not fit.  They are very soft and really cute, tho.  Would order these again - a size up, if offered.I love these, although the 1st time I ordered them, I ordered a size too big :) Oh well I re-ordered the right size and they\\'re perfectI love these underwear I will buy moreIt is flimsy pour materialMy hips are 34\" so a small is a little too big (I wish they offered it in an XS). It started out okay, but eventually loosened up and moved around a lot. The other problem (for me) is the crotch which is cut slim (my bits don\\'t feel fully covered) and is heavily lined. The latter is nice, but considering the looseness it becomes uncomfortable over time. The pluses: it is a well made garment; the color is beautiful; the lace is quality and has a bit of give; there were no panty lines under leggings. It you are a fan of thongs but would like a little more modesty in the rear, I\\'d give this a go (provided the sizing works for you).These are awesome. Very sexy. The high cut in the back really accentuates your shape. They do run a little large, so if you are a tiny girl even the small might not fit too well. I am 5\\'3, 120 lbs with a bit of a booty and the small does fit, but if my butt were any smaller, it would be too lose. I\\'ve bought peacoat and bridal white colors so far. I really like the peacoat shade of blue and my boyfriend declared it my lingerie color... too bad this is literally the only lingerie I have ever seen in this color :/These are adorable especially with the matching bra but it definitely runs big. I ordered a small and I am a size 0-00 24\" waist. It fits but is loose. Order a size or two smaller if you can, which I couldn\\'t do.I bought this pair of panties for my wife to match her b.tempt\\'d bra I purchased for our anniversary.  She says the panties are really comfortable and I think they look fantastic.  We both recommend this bra for a sexy, nice fitting and affordable lingerie set...\\xa0b.tempt\\'d by Wacoal Women\\'s Ciao Bella Balconette Bra, Peacoat, 36DDI love the B\\'Tempted/Wacoal line of lingerie. I just wish they were offered as a matched set instead of getting each item separately. Panties a bit larger than expected, but im still happy!I bought these to go along with: http://www.amazon.com/b-temptd-Wacoal-Womens-Cayenne-Medium/dp/B00NVYDRP2/ref=sr_1_1?&ie=UTF8&qid=1438190596&sr=8-1&keywords=Wacoal+Women%27s+Ciao+Bella+3/4+Bra,+Cayenne,+Medium .  They look amazing with the bra.  I purchased both in the color Cayenne, which I really enjoy.  Definitely recommend both for those who want to expand their lingerie collection!Very nice  underwear.  It looks very nice with the matching bra. I hope that these panties will stand up to general wear. I buy nice  lingerie to make myself happy, so I don\\'t save  nice underwear for \"special occasions\".  If they don\\'t last, I will update my review.i\\'m not sure how underwear sizes work i wear small pants but i got this in medium and it fit.. so.. idk is that considered \"fit as expected\"? is my underwear size supposed to be larger than my pant size? hmm...who know.. but they\\'re really pretty and you should definitely get the bra that matches it too because they\\'re both super cuteGreat design figure flattering. Added bonus is that u can return for s refund which the Fredericksbof Hollywood website does NOT DO. They shorted me $100s of dollars in returned items. But from amazon sellers instead!!!!The style is nice, but I don’t care for panties with a seam right down the middle that goes front to back. Had it not been for this, I would’ve kept them. They fit true to size; I’m 5’8” and 140 and bought a medium.These are super cute. However, they did come with one of the straps disconnected, but since I have a sewing machine I just went and head and stitched it back on. Overall I think they are super cute and comfy....Love the look.  More of cheeky hipster style, than a boy-short.  But a flattering style for me, and the small cutout detail on the back is nice too.  The fit was prefect, and I was pleasantly surprised that these panties are really a pleasure to wear.Very cute. They don\\'t cover much ss they shouldnt. Very pretty and tastefulVery niceLove fredricks  of hollywood lines!Little too largeThey are very comfortable. Sometimes you want a high waisted underwear.I know I prefer that when I wear higher waisted pants or skirts, it just feels better to me. These are breathable and are soft. The colors are nice too. They fit pretty true to size for me.I’m a fan of the “cheeky” undies. These have a great design, that shows just enough cheek, but is comfortable as well. They have good stretch (a bit small, but good motivation!) and the cotton panel makes them breathable.This review is for the Multi-color 6pcs size small. These bikinis hugs low on the hips. I’m usually a x-small and small fits me, so I would recommend that you go up a size or two or follow the chart for sizing.Love the underwear very nice style. But I wish I would have ordered a size bigger. I already ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear. I guess I\\'ll just lose a couple poundsThese undies are sooo cute!! They did come a little small for a size smal (BUT NOT TOO SMALL) just fit a little snug - no muffin top or anything. I love the see through lace 😏😏😏😏These are truly sexy and very comfortable! Arrived packaged well, each underwear is individually packed which I like very much. Seems very durable and nice material!These panties are pretty and fit as described. The designs are gorgeous and the material is breathable. Highly recommended.it is definitely sized wrong I wear a medium and these are almost extra smallVery nice pantie , fit is perfect, good coverage. Low rise is nice. If you’re small like me . 5’6 / 128 lbs . The small fit perfect.All of these underwear unraveled in the wash. (See picture)I wish I could return them.Received my order today and was thrilled with the fit. Just finished washing them and spent 5 minutes unraveling a rat\\'s nest trying to figure out the source. Found that it was one of these pairs of underwear that came undone at the seam in 10 different places. I\\'m not even sure if this pair is even salvageable at this point. All the others are still intact for now, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if this happens to all the others.Soft and fit well. Just make sure to wash on delicate setting with other intimatesLoved the colors, loved the fabric, but one wash in and completely unraveled :( hoping the others will hold up and they a was a fluke.These panties fit exactly as I needed. It’s very hard to find a good pair of panties in a store or online.Ami esposa le quedan muy bonitosA lil small but love em but a bit pricey!Bought for the print. Cute... Full bottom, and has elastic exposed.I was super nervous about buying this because the sizing wasn\\'t consistent from other reviews. Many reviews lacked info about what size they were in typical US sizing....I\\'m 5\\'7 192lbs 36DD/38D,  bottoms size 12/14 (more of a true 14) , tops XL, dresses 14/1x (All US sizing)I ordered the Blue US XL/Tag XXLThis piece is so nice! It fits perfect! If you are the same as my exact sizing above, go with the same size I did. Some who are the same sizing as me with a little more breast or tummy should go up one size.About the lingerie...It\\'s really made of a nice quality. Not cheapy at all. The blue color is vibrant and a true blue like the image. The crotch is open and the back fastens like a typical bra but there is no underwire or support for the breast. I will be ordering the other colors very soon.I was amazed with the quality. I work in an adult store and even with my discount lingerie is too expensive. I never trusted ordering online but with a bonus check decided to give it a try. The lace feels nice on my flesh and I have never seen my husband as turned on as he was when he saw me in this set. I have had six children I am 5’9” and 160 lbs. I ordered an extra large knowing lingerie fits me differently than clothing sizes I normally wear large in. This is definitely going to be a favorite of ours. Easy access for us to have the most amazing intimate time. Easy to slip into. I also kept looking at myself in the mirror. If this company would be willing to send me product to model in without my face I would be completely willing to send unedited photos without my face and just blocking out private areas. It is so important to feel sexy as a woman I just regret waiting until age 36 to discover this. Very happy. Thank You!This is my favorite kind of lingerie because I like to keep my confidence booster on for the ENTIRE evening, if you know what I mean. This gives him access to all the goodies but still gives me sexy coverage where I want it. I have this in 4 different colors and like to buy matching robes for each and I will probably buy other colors too!Husband loves this! lol It\\'s not the nicest of materials but you can\\'t beat the quality/price. It is quite stretchy so even though it fits me a little small it is not uncomfortable.Sexy and cute! Fits right and sexy but as soon as i tried it on, the fabric near where the clasp of the bra is just ripped right away.5 foot 4, 152 lb and I got a large to be safe. I normally fit medium/large for bottoms and a small on top so I played it safe since it\\'s a one piece. The material isn\\'t as soft as I would like it to be, but it\\'s still a well-put-together outfit. Mine did not come ripped in any way. I\\'m a pretty stingy person, so I was a little salty at the price but I do plan to keep using it so I think overall it\\'s worth it. Husband enjoyed it and I felt attractive. Would recommend!Thia lingerie is both super sexy and super kinky. I absolutely loved it. I\\'m 5\\'5, 165lbs and I went with a large--which is the normal size I wear with one piece things, and it fit beautifully.Nice / lacy / fits well & uhh ... doesn\\'t need to come off ... thus ... the wife & I appreciate the overall quality of this piece ...So very soft and pretty fit perfectlySo far two of these have already started to fall apart the first time I wore them. One began to split at the seams while the other the lace began to unravel. At least it saved me from washing them. The just went right into the trash.  I am afraid they will completely fall apart, even with a gentle washing.I ordered two packages of these panties.  While they are very pretty, they run irregularly.  Some of them are close to true to size while others are a little skimpy.  Initially I tried one on and found its fit to be fine but when I tried on the next ones, I found they did not fit the same.  I measured the other panties one against the other and found some of them to be slightly irregular.  I wouldn\\'t order them again.Extremely uncomfortable, might be because they run small. Wish I could’ve sent them back. :(I read the reviews and ordered accordingly. Should have purchased two sizes up rather than one. The are a bit snug, but not too to bad. Great colors and pretty as well.I ordered a size bigger because I read alot of the reviews saying these are a size or 2 too small. For me they weren\\'t. I wish I had ordered my regular size or a size smaller. Also they are super stretchy. I will get other colors and I will order my regular size or even a size smaller. I think they fit bigger.I think these are comfortable and pretty however there is no elastic  or gripping surface at top.  When walking they a prone to slipping down which is extremely frustrating.  Without changing that I will not purchase again.Update: Snag and tear easy!!! Nice but don\\'t expect to last long before all have holes!like the fit so far will see if fall apart seem very flimsy but will see in timeMy BF likes vintage fit lingerie and loves these. Super comfortable but waist is very high. I am 5\\' and it\\'s at least 1\" above my belly buttonI really love these underwear, they are very comfortable! The lace is not itchy and it doesn\\'t ride up throughout the day. I love the colors, they are really beautiful.Pretty panties, sexy. They don’t fit me the way I was hoping. I ordered an XL. Fits like a medium 😖The material is soft and they fit as expected. However, the stitching is already coming apart. They will not last more than a few washes.I\\'m a large in underwear at Victoria Secret.  I\\'m 5f 4in and 150lbs.  The reviews said to size up at least 2 sizes.  A 2xl fits perfect!  I like the high waist because I\\'ve had 2 c-sections and it covers my c-section rolls.  And they are sexy!!!  Husband approved ladies!!These fit great and are super cute. The higher waist gives you nice smooth lines under your clothesIf your a little self conscious about your midsection this high waisted panties are perfect! they hide stretch marks and loose skin. Goes over belly button and not tight. This is best to wear as lingerie, with a dress or very high waisted jeans. Would definitely purchase more!Love these cute panties and all though they\\'re high waisted, they\\'re still sexy!  I\\'m about 5\\'8\" 142 lbs and went with size chart for my size. although they fit, I\\'d like them a little more snug so I\\'m keeping them & reordered another set sizing down!I bought these for my 16 year old daughter. She LOVES them!! The red is so vibrant. & we got 4 pairs for a killer price!! They are sexy but not too revealing. The lace fabric is so nice as well. They are really good quality panties.I\\'m happy with my purchase and so is my daughter. I would totally buy these again.I definitely ordered to allow to fit and still not a good fit. Run very small. Disappointed because they are cute.Cute but ripped easily. A little tight around my hips (I\\'m 4\\'11\", 126 lbs, with small waist and a big ass)So pretty, and well made. I will be buying more. Thicker than expected, which was a pleasant surprise.Very nice and fit well, colors are truly red just wish there were other colors available. The cutouts are perfectly placed.Excellent quality and ridiculously flattering. Hot AFMaterial seems good but fits smallCheap but okI really like the comfortable fitting cotton feel of these panties. They’re really flattering and pretty when worn. Size is perfect not too small or too large. I appreciate that the cut and fit of the underwear doesn’t sit too low or sit too high on the waist/ hips where your panties keep sliding down due to jeans and leggings or pop out. They\\'re really comfortable and I’m a jogger, and being about to jog in comfort fitting underwear is an awesome thing. Good quality breatheable panties. I want more lol!!They are super cute, but the elastic is scratchy and the sizing is way off. I wanted these to be comfy for sleeping, so I even ordered two sizes larger than I needed. Nope, too tight around the waist and the elastic is painfully rough. The leg holes are comfortable but they ride up. I\\'m a size 6/8 about 148lbs and the XL was not a good fit. Price is too high too for this quality.I used to be a loyal to the \"Secret\" brand undies. I got tired of them falling apart in just a couple months. I did some searching on Amazon, checking and reading reviews. I like what I saw in the reviews and decided to give these a try. They did not disappoint.Things I liked:-no panty lines-they do not fit as low on the legs as typical boy short styles, which I like-super comfortable and soft-material quality is VERY nice and high quality-easy care, wash and dry-elasticity is holding up superblyThings I didn\\'t like:-one one thing I can complain about, the lace is becoming tethered in a couple spots after several wearingsI LOVE these undies.I highly recommend and will be buying more.I usually wear a L/Xl, ordered these undies in an Xl and they fit perfectly. They’re super comfortable and cute in general. My biggest concern was that the underwear line would be visible under my scrubs, but because of the lace they’re not!My only complaint is that I put on a new pair after taking a shower, and then 1 hour later I noticed a hole on the front of them. Refer to the pictures, it looks like the seam became undone from the lace. This is easily fixable with a needle and some thread but kind of a bother because they’re literally 1 hour old.Otherwise they’re pretty, breathable, and super comfortable. Not too tight around the thighs, and cover just enough of the butt to be somewhat modest and doesn’t feel like I’m wearing a thong.These are fantastic! I’ve searched far and wide for a comfortable pair of underwear and spent quite a lot of money on big names like Calvin Klein that were a total disappointment  and fell apart in less than a year. These underwear are affordable, extremely comfortable, and great quality. The fabric is nice and thick and cottony feeling. I waited  until I had washed them a couple times before leaving this review as many of the one star reviews were about the underwear falling apart in the wash. So far they have held up beautifully. I will definitely be buying more!I love these panties! I\\'m about 122 lbs with 37 in hips. The mediums fit well, but I probably would have been fine with a small. Good quality and very comfortable.As someone who suffers frequent utis, these undies are order.  Comfortable and don\\'t ride up and super soft.  They are also super cute!These panties are great quality! The fabric is nice and thick and soft. Also they are sewn well. The fit is perfect. I’m like a 42” hip and 31” waist. I ordered the medium and they are perfect. So comfortable!!I am very satisfied with the quality of these lace underwear. It is a great value. 6 pair for less that $20! Love the colors. The material is very soft and they fit comfortably. I wear a size 8 in Jeans and I purchased the mediums. The seat of the underwear was also a good size, which is most important to me! My photos are after one wash.There’s a really nice panties. They’re very soft and they fit really well. They fit as expected, not too small or too large they cover everything needs to be covered and they look really pretty, the lease is soft not scratchy which I really like  these are really nice panties. They’re very soft and they fit really well. They fit as expected, not too small or too large they cover everything that needs to be covered and they look really pretty, the lace is soft not scratchy which I really likeThese are the perfect balance between a full tush coverage and a thong. They are much more comfortable than a thong and much more sexy than a granny panty! I\\'m happy with this purchase. However, they are not what I would call seamless, but I could tell that by the picture, so I got what I was expecting and am happy.This fits as expected and looks really nice.  The material feels nice and it has a cotton lining.  Still looks good after a couple washes.Love how good I look in this undies. They are comfy but sexy at the same time. They fit just right and are very well made. I\\'ve already washed them all a few times and they are perfectly in tact. Definitely my favorite!This is a high quality product, but sized for very petite people. Be sure to order up. The panties themselves are very cute and cozy. Soft materials. Bought as bachelorette gift and bride to be was pleased!These are great quality and fit as expected. Very comfortable to wear. I have washed a few pairs in the delicate cycle and no dryer. They seem to was up nicely. I would highly recommend.These came with litte bows on the front, which my wife didnt realize ... nut nit a bjg deal.  They arent cemented on lol.  Good fit and cut, comfortable for my wife.I bought these a size larger than I normally wear. They were still a little right on my thighs but, nothing breaking them in didn\\'t fix!My biggest problem is that the band isn\\'t seen on very well. I discovered a hole in them upon my first wear. They continued to fall apart until I had to cut the band off and replace it. If these were cheaper, I wouldn\\'t care much. But, they\\'re 10+ dollar glorified underwear, so I expected better quality. However, it\\'s a good lesson in \"higher price doesn\\'t always mean higher quality\".These are ridiculously small. I purchased the largest size which is easily 2-3 sizes too small (for someone who wears a medium or large). They are also made very short in length so \"boy shorts\" is an absolute lie. You have to wear this as a thong for it to be long enough (as in half your butt crack isn\\'t showing) and the leg holes are also too small causing discomfort from the get-go. Incredibly disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend.They fit pretty good! Just a little tight on my butt cheeks but not at all bad.My butt are the k so it said span me for most of the time, but they were cute. I wore them to a festival in San Francisco. I got lost of people asking if they could spank me.These run small for boy shorts, unless your crack is supposed to be exposed. Other than having to rearrange them over and over, they are great quality and love what it says on the back. I recommend ordering a size largerSmallest X-Large I\\'ve ever encountered. I typically wear an X-Large in panties, except at Aerie where the XL falls off my waist so I wear an L. I got them on and they don\\'t feel uncomfortable, but that\\'s after busting out some of the leg seams. They give me a bit of a muffin top and they don\\'t fit my butt right. Not uncomfortable, but I couldn\\'t wear them under jeans as my butt is literally trying to bust out of them and the lines would be noticeable.If you have anything to \"spank\" don\\'t buy this...it\\'s small, poor fabric, just NO!!Waayyy small. I usually wear medium and after reading the size complaints I ordered an X-large figuring itd be big enough. Wrong!! So small I can\\'t even wear them.If you were looking at the band on these underwear and thought,\"Yoga pants!\" you are right! They are so comfy.  I\\'m am in the process of loosing weight, and will return to get these underwear every step of the way!  They are not your sexy weekend underwear, but they are certainly great as your everyday underwear. Don\\'t get me wrong, the underwear are still cute, just not sexy.  I move around a lot in my job, plus I\\'m exercising now, and no wedgies. I threw them in a laundry bag to wash and dry them, no problems at all  (I wash cold, tumble dry low).  Currently, my  HIPS measure 44\".  This is my largest measurement.  Then I ordered per the  provided size chart above.  Just great underwear.  I couldn\\'t be happier.I loved these when I first got them. They really were so comfortable until I washed them. By the second wash they shrunk! Now they are way too tight around my legs and I ordered the largest size they have. 😞Perfect panties.  Soft, comfortable , wash and dry without any problems.  They have a wide, supportive “waistband” which not only  prevents  binding but flattens some of the dreaded muffin top.  They come up to just below my navelColors. Materials. No improvement needed. Gone are my granny panties for this 73 yo.Love these, so comfortable. As plus size it’s difficult to find underwear that doesn’t muffin top. These are fabulous!!! Will definitely get moreThey looked huge for a small, but my daughter tried them and they fit well. She really likes them. She is an equestrian and needs a very full that covers everything so that there are no pantylines in her breeches.I purchased size 7 and they fit perfectly.  They are nice and soft. Only been washed once so far so time will tell how they hold up. For now I\\'m very happy with them.Update: I still find these very comfortable when wearing under my clothing but wearing them to bed is a different story. The legs don\\'t stretch enough to make them comfortable to wear when moving around in bed.They really make from soft cottons. They are high quality and very comfortable. recommend to buy it.Very pretty and sexy shapewear.  Love the lace.  I read a review on amazon where a lady said she worn a size 18 in jeans and she ordered a size 4XL.  She said the shapewear was slightly large on her.  Because I wear a size 18 jean I decided to order 3XL and the fit is perfect.  I really appreciated her sharing the information about her jean size because it helped me to select the correct size for myself.Nobody is perfect despite how much we may love our bodies. I, for one, love my curves, but I also know what is flattering on me and what isn\\'t. Unfortunately, I have to wear a dress this holiday season for a wedding that is NOT flattering on me. I\\'ve purchased and returned, and researched multiple items on Amazon in hopes to find the ideal undergarment that would work to flatter me. From Spanx to complicated contraptions- none seemed to flatter me. I felt like a tube of Pillsbury dough rolls that had just been popped open with the dough spilling out at the seems. Luckily, I ran into these babies.Here we go!Firstly, I value comfort. These have all the comfort of your favorite granny parties.Secondly, the strategic placement of the lace actually works to smooth out love handles WITHOUT SQUEEZING THEM, thus avoiding the Pillsbury dough phenomenon.Thirdly, it\\'s not a body shaper, but it does have some tummy control. It smooths out problem areas rather than aim to make you look like you\\'ve lost a few inches.Overall, I\\'m really impressed by the quality and ability for this product to fulfill its advertised purpose. I can\\'t get over how adorably retro these look.Contrary to many of the reviews here I do not consider these to be \"granny underwear\" (I am 19 for reference). Instead, with how the lower lace is see-through, it gives me a vintage pin up vibe when I first tried them on. I purchased these since I love high waisted briefs as a way to give myself support as a result of a minor childhood injury that flares up once and a while.These have a very well sewn waist, with perfect elastic! They have not ridden down or curled up once since I bought them, and I have not had any defective pairs. That being said, the elastic is not tight enough to hurt when sitting as some of the tighter elastics can, and the lace is still sturdy at the edges, just offering a tasteful window underneath. The top lace is not sheer, but that seems obvious in the pictures of the product anyway.As for the shape wear properties, I cannot say for sure, since I didn\\'t need them for that reason. That being said I did notice a bit of a lift on the back, which was nice, and it did smooth down the overall skin, from what I could tell. I would recommend this product to anyone needing support in their lower abdomen, or looking for modest sexy panties.One last thing to mention that was not quite 5 star worthy: A few of the pink/neutral pairs had a smell I can only describe as chemical/almost fecal? I washed them before putting them on and that got the smell out, but it\\'s worth mentioning it may have been the dye that smelled after being brand new and shoved in a plastic package at who knows what temperature while it shipped.I am 61 years old but a newlywed to my high school sweetheart. I don\\'t like bikini underwear. these briefs are high enough for me to help with tummy control but the pant line is amazing! The lace creates a smooth line so no pant line through my pants and the look.....they are so flattering. I would like some in white to complete my wardrobe.Good amount of control. These are not “control top” they will not magically suck in your tummy and make it flat but they will knock the edge off and be very comfortable and sexy while they’re at it. Also, I think I saw a couple reviews that stated these were not high waisted— I am 5’4 about 140lbs and they come up 2-3 inches above my belly button. Also, I’ve washed these in the washing machine (with all my other clothes because I’m a Neanderthal) and hung them to dry several times over that last couple months and have had no problems.The only problem I have with this product is that you have no choice in the colors you get. I also wish there was an all cotton option, as I generally hate wearing nylon panties.*However* these panties are pretty, appear to be well made (only one wash, so far) and fit very nicely. They are flattering for a girl with curves and don\\'t create weird bulges, which can be a challenge to find.I\\'m only writing this review because most of the others seem to be in exchange for free underwear, which this isn\\'t.These are nice, pretty panties and I\\'m glad that they come in larger sizes in good colors ata reasonable price.Definitely satisfied with this purchase 😌I LOVE these underpants!  They are sooooo comfortable...they stay put and don\\'t ride up your butt.  Plus, you CANNOT see them thru pants or leggings.  The spandex keeps you nice and tight, and the lace on the top of the leg is very comfortable as to not bind.  The waistband is also great.  I LOVE the RED!!  I wish I could buy 6 more pair in red!! Gals...we all know we feel good/sexy with new underwear.  These are perfect.  I bought 6 more pair and threw all my old junkie stuff out.  I highly recommend these!!I expected to get at least one neutral pair in my pack and I got one white, 2 black and 3 colors, which is frustrating since I need the neutral.Very pretty and make me feel better about wearing granny underwear.  I\\'m 5\\'5\", 145lbs, 34D-32-41.  I have a a tummy and a round butt.  And I ordered the Medium.  These don\\'t have as much butt coverage as I would like.  The seam where the lace and nylon section of the underwear meet is on my butt cheek, which makes me feel a bit like I\\'m getting a wedgie.  The lace extends to where full coverage underwear usually extend but I\\'d rather it be the nylon section.  If I had it to do again, I\\'d probably order these instead https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017E3E8WQ?psc=1.They held up well in the wash and I hung them to dry.  I don\\'t recall how soft the lace was before I washed them but I washed them once with fabric softener and it is very soft now.This is from the website shein. I normally wear a medium but this said it ran large so I ordered a small and it\\'s still a but roomy. If you\\'re very petite I wouldn\\'t recommend this although I like it. Definitely cheaply constructed however.This outfit is super stinkin\\' cute!! I ordered the large (5\\'3\", 160, 36D, med-large) and it fits perfect! It\\'s very soft and comfortable to wear, the color and style is true to picture, and the cup actually covers everything (whaaat?), and the shorts are cute and flirty, the band doesnt dig or pinch on me at all, you can wear them high waisted or lower on the hips. The ONLY knitpick is that the lace along the bottom was sewn along the edge, but the top half was not sewn flush, so it rolls down. Not a big deal, easy fix with a couple stitches, don\\'t think I even care enough to bother because it detracts nothing from how great it looks! Will definitely buy again, would love some more color options in this soft style because I\\'m not real big on silks.I will have the cutest gift at the lingerie party for my girls bachelorette! I order 2 sets bc I couldn’t pick one, and I’m so glad bc both are so cute. Fabric quality is nice for the price! I do recommend sizing up, for example the bride wears a medium normally, but I ordered large and it looks to be the perfect size! I normally don’t take time to review but I was so please with this buy, I wanted to share!Ridiculously soft and doesn\\'t look cheap looking, which is the reason for my 4 stars.  Unfortunately, i had to return because it didn\\'t fit.  I\\'m 5\\' 130lbs, 34D.  I wear a medium in juniors and a small in women\\'s.  I ordered a medium because I thought this was asian sizes.  It is not.  The bottoms fit loose, which wasn\\'t bad, but the top ran large around the band and in the titty pockets (idk what they are called).Absolutely love these shorts! I bought these for back to school and wanted them to be like the Brandy Melville shorts, and they were! Nothing wrong with them when delivered, and are exactly what I wanted. I am a medium, and it was true to size. Love these!This product is a cute and sexy lingerie or pajama set. Let me start off by saying, the bottoms fit amazingly, they are comfortable and make me feel like a tiny goddess. For reference, I am about 110 pounds, and a small fit perfectly. But, the top is ill-fitting, as the lace comes too far up and droops, and it is baggy on the sides. Not sure if it is because I am not \"well-endowed\" or the cut of the top isn\\'t good. Either way, I think the purchase was worth it for the shorts alone, as they\\'ve become my favorite lounge shorts.I’m glad I read the reviews! I was crossing my fingers hoping it would fit and it does. It’s a medium. lol. Whut. I normally wear a dress size 14. My measurements are 44, 36, 47. I would totally have chosen an xl. The pink/white set is made from rayon. It’s pretty dang stretchy and super soft.I am a lingerie addict, I have more than I know what to do with, but this came in last week and it is now my FAVORITE outfit!! I even slept in it as pajamas one night. it is soooo soft and comfortable. It’s cute. flowy. high waisted. anyone would look cute in this outfit. could not recommend enough. I just ordered another style from this brand and I’m so excited.This is a nice piece of lingerie for the price. I got the blue color and it is like a royal blue - pretty pop of color. It fits true to size but the underwear did not fit me well I have too much booty for them.Just like the picture colors and size are great, no support for the girls! If you are bigger in the chest, you will need a pretty lace bar for support otherwise your girls will fall out the slits with movement.My husband loved this on me! He said the material is so soft and the teddi cut really is flattering on a plus size woman. I purchased this one in black and for the price it’s so worth it. Stop wasting your money at places like Victoria Secret or a touch of a romance. Those places are overpriced and you will get the same quality here.Fit perfectly and great fabricThis is great for plus size women, it hugs curves and accentuates all assets. It is very pretty and makes me feel good wearing it. I was surprised underwear fit as well, they look good worn together.This is my first time ever purchasing lingerie, and being plus size I was really nervous this would tank miserably. I ordered a few sizes up since I wanted a loose fit over my abdomen, I’m a DD so the top fit fairly well, there isn’t really any support but the straps are adjustable so I’m not worried about anything slipping out, it’s just like a brackets fit. This item gives me so much confidence, and I can’t wait to surprise my boyfriend on vacation now!First time purchasing lingerie I ordered a 3x wich is the size that I normally wear and it fits perfectly I ordered the purple looks good, very comfortable and my husband loved it!!!this is a super cute and comfortable babydoll lingerie set. I really like how soft the fabric is. The fit is small. I suggest ordering 1-2 sizes larger for fit.These are so beautiful and so comfy!!! And completely seamless! I can wear them with my tightest leggings and you can’t see a thing! I am also obsessed with the lace detail and how it comes together in the front- I feel so pretty!!Very good silky material but fits more like cheeky/thong panties if you are curvier! The picture looks like they would cover more cheek...I loved them as I saw themSurprised the large fit meFits perfectlyDon’t see imprint on tight clothing that well29” waist40” hipsToo small based on the size chart. But I actually have a butt to fill these out, and this makes them just a bit too tight.Fits like a thong if you have junk in the trunk.These are so nice. The material is nice and the lace is sexy. I wear a size 28 or 29 in jeans and I returned the size M for a size L. Very glad I did, now they are perfect. They even wash well. Love the colors too.I love those. They are not as uncomfortable as thong but definitely as sexy !!!The panties were as pictured and ran true to size. Fun colors and a sexy look for a great price! Amazon Prime delivered as promised too! Great experience.nice material not itchy or sewn weirdNot the best quality, not as ruched in the back as I was hoping for. Gives no shape. Was a little bigger than expected.I got a size too large but after 3 washes they seemed to shrink enough to wear these are your general style of these panties in a good package deal tho if you need panties in a pack this is a good choiceThe sizes run really big AND they don\\'t have the normal amount of elasticity to them like most other panties I wear, (like very little) so they are like kinda falling off me.  I wear size 6 medium, bought size medium, and they\\'re too big and just ughh. Plus after a couple of days of wearing them they are starting to show quite a few loose threads:(  Too bad because I really like the way they look (cute bows on each side in the front and lace trim, very pretty).  Bye;)They fit well, look very nice.  Only one thing, we wish there was more support. My wife says they need more spandex. Super sexy.I really liked the design how cute these were and how soft the fabric was,  but idk if i got a bad pack or something but two of mine tore at the seams. The company was really good at customer service tho and refunded me for the damaged panties. I ordered small even tho I\\'m a medium and they fit great.I bought these to have something cute.  I LOVE THEM!  They\\'re the most comfortable fitting on my hips, and they\\'re very flattering.  I\\'ve recommended them to a few friends.I\\'m a size 14/16 pant size and ordered xlg. They\\'re super cute and fit comfortably and well. I\\'ll be ordering more.“Free Size” means size Small I assume. This is a great idea if the panties fit properly. They panties are extremely small, so If you are a size Medium and UP Do Not buy this. Very nice quality, but its Not one size fits all.Loved it and fits up top if you have big boobs this is for youThis is unbelievably soft and so cute! It comes with a little thong. It fit perfectly. I ordered a M and I am 5”7’ and weigh 140.  Very happy with this purchase.It\\'s so cute and comfy. I ordered a Medium...which would be my usual size.  It fit...but it just fit...like if I gain a few pounds, it will be too tight. Plus the material is clingy enough to show any fat rolls. So I returned it for a Large. :)5\\' 4\\' / 140lbs / 34C (Pear shape)Super soft and comfortable! I really would lounge in this all day long if I could.  Buy for your busy size most definitely.I like the night gown. It came well packaged and it wasn\\'t damaged.  It\\'s really comfy and I love the color red. I wear it around the house and sleep with it.Large fit perfectly! I am 5’3” 145lbs and the gown fits perfectly.I love the softness of this product. It’s very sexy but also comfortable. My husband also very much enjoyed it! Great product for the price!Comfy and cuteI am 5’10 and curvy. Some lingerie, fits weird or too big. This lingerie was PERFECT! My man couldn’t keep hands off of me and that opening at the bottom, spiced up our bedroom. Lol I will ordered more and in different colors.Love, Love this purchase. I’m 5’3...198 lbs. This Lingerie is perfect. Makes me feel and look beautiful. My husband adores and enjoys it too. 😉The perfect lingerie! flattering and super seductive. It fits perfect on my body and sooo sexy! I love the lace it is so soft against my skin. My man couldn’t keep hands off of me and that opening at the bottom easy access. spiced up our bedroom.It\\'s hard to find things that are comfortable when you\\'re 😉😉 but this was so sexy and cute. Only down side is my bottom half is a little more plump than my upper so the top was a smidge big!BeautifulMaybe I\\'m too big for a Medium because it was super tight putting over my stomach. Im 5,10 170 with a 32 waist. Where the lace attaches, there is no elastic for wiggle room. Once I heard the dreaded sound of the thread snapping, I knew this was a no go. Other than that, very pretty! I\\'d like to replace it and maybe get a large.Oh I was looking forward to wearing this. 2 months ago I had my 3rd baby in under 3 1/2 years. Needless to say I got this to feel sexy. But I received it today, tried it on and it’s such an odd fit. The straps are adjustable, which is nice.  The torso is sort of short. (I’m 5’3” and never considered myself long in the torso) It is not just crotchless, it’s buttless too.. the fabric does spread so it covers a bit. But the slit from the front goes aallll the way up the butt too. Super sexy and great material. It just didn’t look that way on my post partum body. The slit part went up pretty far.. it spread open over my belly and my c-section scar. So it was giving a sneak peek of what I was trying to hide. If i adjusted the straps to move the waist down to cover the scar, my boobs looked saggy and spread apart. It just wasn’t for me sadly.Very sexy , great material!Great quality, sexy style. True to size. Better support than I thought it would have. WORTH IT. DON\\'T LET THIS ONE LADY WHO WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO GIVE IT TWO STARS BECAUSE HER MAN RIPPED IT OFF HER RUIN YOUR WELL MADE DECISION. I worked in the fashion industry. The panties and top are top notch quality. Some of the best and the strongest I\\'ve ever bought on Amazon (and I\\'ve bought a lot).Pretty soft and cute. It’s pretty transparent lacy that feel so sexy ><I am 117lb and 5\"2- I bought a small and it fit perfectly. I love the lace and the pattern and how soft the material is. It hides and reveals all the right areas, a totally attractive lingerie! Perfect for lounging around the house or for \"in the mood\" moments with a loved one.I liked the overall fit of this set but the issue is that the underwear is completely made out of lace and has no solid cotton insert for the groin area so if you wear it expect to get lace all up in your lady parts (which is not the most comfortable thing). Will keep the top for a bralette but definitely won’t wear the bottoms.I ordered a Large, but I\\'m typically an X-large. I sized down because people said the material was stretchy, which it is. My problems were the straps being too STRECTHY and the fabric of the panties. The panties roll down with vigorous movement, due to sizing. I would\\'ve gotten the X-large but fixed the straps to my liking (probably sewing the straps down across the back or neck area). I chose the red color. Very pretty color choice for me, just wrong sizing.So a couple things about this are letting me down. First let me say I ordered a 2x (18) and while it technically fits, the band that goes under the breasts isn\\'t wide enough to give the same look as in the photos. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t think I\\'m suddenly going to look like the model, I did expect the proportions to be the same but the band doesn\\'t go far enough down the ribs to have the same type of look. The breast \"cup\" portion also doesn\\'t really seem scaled up to the right size, my nipple is barely still under it. It is very comfortable and stretchy but not appropriate for under a tank bc there is no support. The underwear isn\\'t lined and looks the exact same from front and back so it isn\\'t immediately apparent which direction you should wear it and probably would not be good for day wear. Basically if you\\'re plus size the bra is not going to look very good and if you want this to wear as a comfy, no wire, day time bra then keep looking. If you are just looking for something for the bedroom then this is a good choice.So the bottoms fit perfect. I am 5’1 and the top was a bit loose. But I think this has to do with the shape of my body. I am a bit pear shaped so smaller up top and curvier hips/butt/thighs. I think it would be easy enough for me to fix with my very basic sewing skills. So I am a happy customer!I’m a big chested (DDD) women and got a large and it fit great. Didn’t feel like I was going to fall out. The bottoms fit perfect too. The quality of the lace it amazing. Doesn’t rip easy.I\\'ll spare you the photo! I don\\'t think i\\'ve purchased a pair of panties outside of a Victoria Secret in 10+ years. I gained some weight this year and needed to upsize my selection. Rather than paying VS prices to start all over I went on a limb with these. They are exactly the same quality if not better than the lace thongs VS sells. I\\'m buying more today and it feels like I\\'ve figured out the \"great panty secret!\"  I\\'m 5\\'4 and around 140 lbs. with prominent hips and booty - purchased size LARGE.Maybe I\\'m weird, but I find thong panties comfortable and wear them every day. These are nice, comfy cotton thong panties that are perfect for that. Are thongs sexy? Sure. But when I\\'m just walking around or at work or something, I ain\\'t about \"sexy\". I\\'m about \"comfy\" and these work. I ordered \"large\" and wear women\\'s size 10-12 pants, FYI.I\\'m disappointed in the ways this lay on my bod.  I\\'ve worn thongs before but I never bought the ones with lace band that is supposed to eliminate lines.  This may be about the way I\\'m shaped... I know I ordered the right size, but with my shape the lace ends-up folding and making a BIGGER, more obvious line than the normal thongs I\\'ve worn in the past.  I would refer you to the photo review some \"gentleman\" took of his wife in these panties.If you\\'re used to a thong where the back band is pretty much above your tush - these are not the ones for you.  The band on these are kind of like a hipster hipster brief height - all the way around.  There are probably very flat tummied people on whom this lace would remain flat, but I am not she.PS - they are very pretty in my undies drawer.My measurements for reference:  34\" bust, 26\" waist, 38\" hips, 5\\'8\" tall, 135lbs.  I ordered a SMALL based on reviews, & the lace band is a bit tighter than I expected, but I\\'m confident a medium would be too big.  The size is very similar to the \"one-size\" Maidenform pairs that are almost identical to these, but these have a cotton, not a lace panty zone, & the lace band does have a good amount of stretch, but as I said, it\\'s just a tiny bit tight.  Overall though, these are perfectly well-made undies & I\\'ll likely very purchase more down the road.  As others have said, I do wish they offered more colors/prints, as the 2 sets available are a bit drab.  But for this price, & just to wear to work, who cares?!I just simply love it.  I bought S  and i  wear pants  size 5 or 27 . Hips 39inch. Fit perfectly.  Super soft and elegant fabric. Colors beautiful.  No demages.  Just the best panties ever. Recommended  highly.I’ve gained a lot of weight since being 7 months pregnant. I usually wear hanky pankies (when I was 125lbs) but they were becoming a bit too small and not stretchie enough for my belly. These are perfect. I’m around 160 lbs now with a big belly and these fit perfectly without pulling at all and the gusset is large enough as well. I ordered the xl. Super soft nice cotton and stitches may not be as quality as others but lace is stronger and the panty is much more breathable and comfortable. I will def order more.I\\'m 5\\'6\", 32-29-39, and ordered the Neutral pack in size Small.  I suggest ordering your usual thong size, since I would have been a size medium according to their chart (every body is different).  These are cute, sexy thongs!  It\\'s so hard to find cotton nude colored thongs to wear under lighter colored leggings or leggings that might not be 100% squat-proof.  These thongs fit the bill.  I washed them in a lingerie bag in cold water, then hung to dry.  I haven\\'t noticed any ripping or pilling in the lace as other reviews have stated, which is probably due to my use of the lingerie bag.  I can see how the lace might get caught on and destroyed by zippers and buttons of other garments.  The lace is stretchy, and very comfy.  The V coverage is just right, and made of cotton!  I don\\'t like the idea of synthetic material in my nether-region for health reasons.  These don\\'t pinch, slide, or ride up, but the lace band has a tendency of rolling down sometimes at my hips.  Not a major issue, but if you\\'re curvy, the band might never lay flat.  I wear these under shorts, jeans, and leggings at the gym.  If these last through the year, I\\'ll definitely buy more!These seem to be good quality, and I like them. I\\'m about 170 pounds, my waist is about 35\" hips about 45\", and I ordered a medium. The waistband fits perfectly, although the rest is a little big. But not so big that they\\'re uncomfortable.Very sexyGood productLooks great on the wife fit her greatI\\'m a Womens 8 & hippy. I adjusted these at almost the longest length and they fit great. It\\'s basically elastic with a teeny tiny triangular shaped patch of cheap material. I bought some cupcake pasties to pair it with and added thigh-high stocking, patent leather heels, & sheer black robe. Voila! My boyfriend loved it.This thong is super cute and looks and does exactly as expected. I really like that it\\'s adjustable around the waist and the black/red kisses design is super cute. It\\'s hard to find black breakaway thongs anywhere and they\\'re always ridiculously expensive. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the material. It\\'s a decently stiff fabric (nylon/spandex) and not as nice looking as some of the more expensive (or even comparably priced) breakaway or micro thongs.Not the greatest quality thong, but your not paying quality prices. Gave these to my mistress, because my wife didn’t want them. She said they were too small for her poochy belly and that her ass looked too flat in them. My mistress loved them though so not a total loss.So tiny they barely cover anything... isn\\'t that the ideas!Perfect thong design in a great color. This underwear design was  provided by the same company that provided the silver metallic model that did not fit me ... as I described in one of my previous reviews. The difference is that this pink thong is made with a stretchy fabric in a design that provides a longer elastic string for the legs. I plan to order this same pattern in other colors now that I have found that it fits well.My wife loves the design, but finds it a bit uncomfortable around \"her area\". Looks real attractive of course. She\\'s a wear a small.Ordered this for my girlfriend, with her looking as well, and I just have to say she looks OMFG delicous in them! And she said they made her feel on fire!!The adjustability is a huge plus since the \\'patch\\' is so beautifully tiny,, mmmJust wished it was offered in more colors, we\\'d buy the line if they where!very small - for fun onlyWorst quality of anything I have ever purchased. Nothing like the picture.You get what you pay forDid not like it at all. Too small and cheap quality.Straps were not even attached and the fabric was very poor qualityQuality was super cheapColor and texture was not as picturedAnd I ordered up and still wasn’t enoughPoor quality, nothing like the picture!Do not buy this product. It’s a thin net material and doesn’t fit at all. I bought it two sizes bigger and when you try to return they will only offer you 20% back.Very thin material.Size up at least once if you have an average/bigger butt. The designs don’t look right because they are too tight and won’t fit over your cheeks. Some are very cute! Do yourself a favor, size up!Great designs but 4 of the panties are not made from stretch material so I’m only able to wear one, maybe two. No XL available.I would have given 5 stars but they defiantly run small. I usually wear a md/lg in Aerie or VS. I thought I’d better order the lg just Incase. They are cute and sexy. If you have a big booty (which I have none!) definitely size up!The undies were great. Big turn on super comfortable but the thongs are a no go. They are just strings that make me have rolls where i dont have rolls and the beads pinchThese are made of extremely soft and sturdy materials. Remarkable quality for the price.However, the photo would lead you to believe that on the larger ones, the front is open, but the way they fit correctly is with the back open. These would be great if this is what you want, just not what I was looking for or had expected from the photos.I bought these in a large though I normally wear a medium. They fit perfect and look great! Great looking lingerie.I love all of them! They are a little bit small so I would recommend ordering a size up :)Very cheaply made. The leg holes are unevenly cut. Not flattering at all!!! The thong length doesnt even go to the top of my crack, sorry if thats tmi but seriously, its ridiculous. I even went according to the sizing chart. Honestly a waste of my money, not even worth the return. I just tossed them.I love this set ! My favorite set I\\'ve gotten so far. It is more gorgeous than I expected. The color is as shown. Everything looks great and fits perfectly. I want to get more colors.Very good quality and looks exactly the same with images. I usually don\\'t think this lingerie will be comfortable, but unexpectedly, it is so soft, I don\\'t. Want to take off it. Recommend it to every girls.For size reference I am 5’5, 157 lbs, and ordered the XLWant to see what this looks like on a real person? It’s not terrible, right? Lol. I like it. I think the husband will too!If you’ve breast fed a few babies you might need to layer this bralette with something with more support if you want a lifted look. That’s what I plan to do.For the price it\\'s fantastic! I\\'m 5\\' 5\", 123lbs, 32DD and went with the small. It fits perfectly and is actually comfy! Would def buy againI\\'m 4\"11 and 95 lbs and S fits perfectly. The purple color is exactly as pictured and it is very comfortable. I have fake breasts that don\\'t require any support so this really does look awesome on. And my husband agrees it looks even better. It covers your nips and has a little elastic strings that go around your breasts for a sexy peekaboo effect. I cant believe how comfortable this lingerie is. I absolutely love it! I recommend this product!!The top does not cover as much breast area as shown in the picture. I am a 38D and pop out every which way. I did however have the bottoms fit perfect and for that reason alone I\\'m deciding to keep because they are sexy.When I opened the package I thought the top looked too small. It\\'s pretty sexy and feels soft very similar to t-shirt material. Perfect fit.I am surprised this fits! I just went on a whim and bought it and I’m glad I did! I’m pretty curvy my hips are 40 inches and my bra size is a 36D and it fits perfectly! I think if my bra size was any bigger it wouldn’t fit.I was really pleasantly surprised by these! I was looking for a truly high waisted indie for my high waist jeans cuz I have the feeling of undies that don’t come up to my tucked-in shirt! These are super high rise but also they don’t squeeze your leg and create panty lines!! Kind of a perfect pair of undies and super cheap too!!!!Lace is good quality.  The tummy area while not a control too, is snug and holds your stomach in.  Loved the fit. Loved the way it looks under clothing.  You can’t feel them when you’re wearing them.  Which is what I consider a perfect fit for me.  Chuckle. I bought one to try.  I promptly purchased two more!!And this panty looks and feels just like the photo and just like you want it to.  I purchased my normal size and it fit perfectly.  I have no complaints at all...which is really surprising.  lol.  I am 5\\'4  130 lbs about a 29 in jeans in the waist and I ordered a M in these panties.These panties fit perfectly and are a nice balance between coverage and sexiness. They smooth out all the imperfections and never need to be adjusted. I\\'m very satisfied with this purchase.Absolutely love these high waisted panties they are true to size I am 5 ‘6 150 pounds and I purchased extra large highly recommendLove these panties and always get lots of compliments when I wear themFit well, comfortable, look goodI love the way these look and feel on! The lace is very soft, not scratching at all. I ordered more and cannot wait to get them!Great quality hundred percent cotton was good durable stitches on each side love the lase it’s soft and stretchableLooks finesewing beautifulThe fabric is not very simpleIt looks like it won\\'t deform easilyFinding the right fit for knickers online can be tricky.They came in a pack of 4, But i would have preferred if there was also a choice of a 6 pack, So i could wear them every day of the week.It is Modest but flirty with lace details on the edge of the panties, And they also have a good stretch to them. I find them to be comfortable and i use them for everyday wear.Lovely pants, material is so soft and extremely comfortable to wear. I’ve even worn them to bed and been comfortable all night and didn’t cut in anywhere. They wash well. I would recommend these pants for comfort and look.This brief is comfy, feels soft.The most important point is comfy to wear. I have ordered more in small size.Soft, comfy, fits well. I have a generous bum, and these cover it.Runs smallwifefits perfectIt’s cute and comfortableFits good. Exactly as described.Hey guys, I wanted too update my review, while I love the simple look of this bralette, I returned it.  When I put it on again, it felt too tight around the middle.  I still think it\\'s adorable and a great price - it\\'s more that I hate anything tight around my middle - that\\'s partly why I don\\'t wear bras unless I really have to.Color me green/lucky! I  ordered this on April 19th and I really like this bralette! It actually fits me well and is representative of the actual size it purports to be!  I ordered a medium and that\\'s what I got.  I will say it\\'s not that tight around the middle part but I like that - I don\\'t like anything tight under rmy breasts - hence why I don\\'t buy bras usually. I also heard that restriction to your breasts is not good. Easy for me to say right? I\\'m a 34B! I hear all you ladies out there that are larger and don\\'t have a choice in terms of having to wear wire bras or ones that keep you \"in\" but I am saying, if/when possible? Let the girls roam!  I feel really lucky that I am small busted because it allows me the freedom to wear bralettes and be a litlte bit more casual/free.  The price on this bralette is also really good and I actually like the color a lot - while not a beige - that blends in - it is kind of neutral/or a quiet green if you will.  Oh, it also comes with a pretty little bag!  If you\\'re wondering whether to get it? Go for it! It comes in red as well and I may buy that one as well!This is an ok string bikini. First, the lace is relatively soft, which is my main issue with most laces panties (scratchy lace). Second, they are wide enough up front to accomodate things most of the time. Now, I took off 2 stars for a couple reasons. The waist elastic is not very stretchy. I am a mens US medium, which is typically a womens large\\\\7. So I ordered a large; however, it is somewhat tight in the waist. Also, the back, even though it is sexy, does not even try to stay in place. Just walking makes the back ride up, making this a little uncomfortable for daily wear.This is one way to make people more comfortable with breastfeeding.Looks really nice and my wife likes the material. I listened to the reviews and ordered a size bigger then I normally get for her, and it fits her nicely.I really like how this bralette looks and fits! My bra size is 34B and I usually get a size medium in most clothes. They were out of mediums, so I got a small. It ended up fitting great! I don\\'t really like wearing bras or things that feel super tight, but this was a comfortable fit. It was also good quality lace that doesn\\'t look like it will just unravel and fall apart (which is a problem I find with some lace clothing). Would recommend!This was a perfect fit for me (I’m 34 B/C) and gives the perfect amount of support without feeling constricted and NO yucky, lymph slowing/breast cancer causing underwire! And the color is rich and elegant, perfect for this gal (who thinks olive is better than black as a more interesting neutral)... just wish there were more colors to have fun with!I ordered this in the olive green color, and it is pretty cute. I\\'m not in LOVE with it-- I wish the olive were a little darker color, it\\'s a little bright for my taste. I also ordered a large-- I\\'m a 32D, so I figured a large would accommodate my cup size, which it does perfectly. However, then it\\'s a little too loose around the band. I wish it were a *smidge* tighter. It\\'s so tough, everyone\\'s girls are so different! BUT, this is super cute overall- I love the style and will definitely wear it. Don\\'t wear it in cases of needing a ton of support-- there\\'s no wire or really form to it, so it doesn\\'t do much in that regard.I’ve gotten a bralette from this company before and I adore it, so I decided to try this one out as well. To no surprise, it’s amazing as well! This one is very cute, almost like a bikini top, so I don’t feel shy about wearing it under a sheer top or where it can peek out and show off a bit of lace. The front clasp is cute as well and easy to use. I didn’t even have to adjust it when I first tried it on, it fit perfectly! I would really recommend this, it is such a adorable bralette and great for a variety of outfits.I love this bra! It is so cute and comfortable! I want one in every color! At first I was hesitant because the front closure wasn\\'t adjustable, but the band has a lot of comfortable stretch which fits a wide variety of band widths. I am a 32C, but I could see it fitting up to a 36 maybe wider. The lace/embroidery is soft and well made. There are no loose strands or threads. I like that there is no underwire, so it doesn\\'t cut into my body. It really is the prettiest little comfy bra I have now!!My wife\\'s ass looks great in these!I followed the size chart and measured- came too small. Also the style is not cut like briefs, hard to see how these are named boy briefs?  Should be hipster bikini.I love the soft material, I bought this item again after trying them out! Highly recommend. They stay put. I wash them in a net bag to avoid lace tips. I don\\'t feel the lace, thankfully. I\\'m curvy so super happy these stay in place and are not binding. Love!Good full coverage underwear. I wanted boy shorand style so I could have a little more coverage at night. I normally wear a large so that’s what I ordered. It fits fine though I wish the band was just a little looser or at least softer.These are fantastic. The cotton is breathable and they don\\'t shift. These are my favorite. I\\'m buying anther package of them.Underwear is fine. Fits comfortably, and the only/lace-up/how is a cute touch. Normal seams, so watch for traditional panty line problems. Can often find similar fitting items for cheaper.I read the reviews and thought I would be happy, but I have been wearing seamless underpants too long and found these to be uncomfortable due to that. There is nothing wrong with them - it\\'s just for me I couldn\\'t deal with them having seams.Its very difficult to find cute panties that are all cotton and I was hesitant to purchase these at first. The fit was great, and style is perfect, not your usual granny panties.I am very satisfied with the quality of these lace underwear. It is a great value. 6 pair for less that $20! Love the colors. The material is very soft and they fit comfortably. I wear a size 8 in Jeans and I purchased the mediums. The seat of the underwear was also a good size, which is most important to me! My photos are after one wash.There’s a really nice panties. They’re very soft and they fit really well. They fit as expected, not too small or too large they cover everything needs to be covered and they look really pretty, the lease is soft not scratchy which I really like  these are really nice panties. They’re very soft and they fit really well. They fit as expected, not too small or too large they cover everything that needs to be covered and they look really pretty, the lace is soft not scratchy which I really likeThese are the perfect balance between a full tush coverage and a thong. They are much more comfortable than a thong and much more sexy than a granny panty! I\\'m happy with this purchase. However, they are not what I would call seamless, but I could tell that by the picture, so I got what I was expecting and am happy.This fits as expected and looks really nice.  The material feels nice and it has a cotton lining.  Still looks good after a couple washes.Love how good I look in this undies. They are comfy but sexy at the same time. They fit just right and are very well made. I\\'ve already washed them all a few times and they are perfectly in tact. Definitely my favorite!This is a high quality product, but sized for very petite people. Be sure to order up. The panties themselves are very cute and cozy. Soft materials. Bought as bachelorette gift and bride to be was pleased!These are great quality and fit as expected. Very comfortable to wear. I have washed a few pairs in the delicate cycle and no dryer. They seem to was up nicely. I would highly recommend.These came with litte bows on the front, which my wife didnt realize ... nut nit a bjg deal.  They arent cemented on lol.  Good fit and cut, comfortable for my wife.Súper comfy high waisted panties. Material is cotton and is super soft. Fits true to size and rides high around the waistI have been looking for some high-waisted styles which are not too restrictive.  These are nice quality and breathable.  I don\\'t find them too restrictive, but they do offer some support.  I will likely buy more soon.Very, very nice quality, impressed with that part but size way off. Selected medium size, they are entirely too tight, cuts off circulation!uncomfortable after washingI like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitGreat undies! They\\'re comfortable, flattering, don\\'t cause wedgies, and the lace at the back edges minimizes panty lines.Update after owning for 3 months: These are already falling apart. The lace is getting holes in it...it\\'s difficult not accidentally putting a finger through the lace trying to put them on. Granted, I have been putting these in the dryer after washing so that may be why the lace is more brittle, but I haven\\'t had this issue with other lace underwear.these were very cute, sexy, and comfy, but they had a very thick seam in the crotch that was uncomfortable to sit on so I sent them back. If the seam had been sewn down or not so thick, I\\'d have loved them. the XL was pretty large compared to typical size 8/XL panties, so they might run a bit big.I can\\'t say enough about these. I always used to buy Victoria\\'s Secret underwear and they were costing a fortune. I needed some new underwear and I read the reviews and they seemed to be like the same material as Victoria Secrets so I purchase them. Love love love them.There are six in a box, and it\\'s really cotton underwear. It\\'s comfortable and just fine.I like these underwear, because they are comfy and cute. They are a thicker cotton material so more likely to show seams, and my one complaint is that there is a seam in the perineal area (low buttocks) that seems like it would cause pimples if you sat in them too long or if they rubbed the wrong way. However, they are very comfy, flexible and good for curvy girls.love lace soooo much!!! i always buy lace panties from victoria secret which is little expensive.but i found this on amazon i want give it a try since the price is great.i bought this pack panties in size s which is fit ok for me.the colors are good that is not too bright,they are classic.the panties are made of soft cotton,feel comfortable.i would buy more if i need more.My search is finally over.  These are the best!!  They are all cotton (exactly what I wanted) so soft and comfortable. I washed them immediately and wore a pair for the first time today. No pantie lines and these are my new favorite. As a matter of fact I’m getting rid of most of my undies and I’ll be buying more of these. I’m a size 6 and the mediums fit perfect.I was a little skeptical at first whenever I removed them from the box, but once I tried them on I am 100% in love! They cover enough, and the waist band is high enough to hold in my little belly pooch. I followed other reviews and purchased my usual size that I buy from V.S. and they fit like a charm. Fingers crossed they hold up in the long run!!So happy with this purchase! I got the set of 6.  They were delivered in a cute little gift box. The colors are true to the photos and they seem very well made. The lace in the back is very pretty and intricate! I’m not sure what the material is, it’s not cotton and is a little shiny, so I’m not sure how they’ll wash yet. I’m 5’8 and 150lbs., got the small and they fit perfectly. Recommend!I am 5’8” 205 lbs, curvy, usually wear an 18w.  Size XL fit me nicely.  Very pretty.  Will probably order more.  Recommend!I ordered size large since I usually wear a size 8 in jeans. They were a little more high waisted than I thought they would be but fit comfortably. Since they are lace, I put them in a net bag to wash and hung to dry and they’ve held up well in the laundry. They came in a cute pink box that would have been perfect as a gift box had the scan bar been put on the bottom instead of the top. It doesn’t peel off easily at all. I am very pleased with the colors. The lace is soft and not itchy at all as some can be.Really cute packaging. As a girl with some junk, I always have issues with tighter waistbands and leg holes. I was hoping these would be seamless and as smooth as Lacey pantries can be but they are a little tighter in those areas and makes things looks bulgier than they should. Now I have to lose a few to wear em!I love these panties. They are comfortable and cute/sexy. For reference i am 5’2 175 lbs and curvy. I ordered the xl. I could have got away with a large but i went up a size just to make sure it covered my butt and didn’t give me a wedgie. They are perfect. Highly recommend these.So I was attracted to this panty because of the lace and satin:)....Getting all the colors in the mail solidified my opinion.  Very comfortable....Very Sexy!!!....I\\'m a 34\" waist...Thought an XL was the way to go....A large would have worked, but the XL isn\\'t overly large....They\\'re very comfy, but two of them had loose strings when I took them out of the box. The pink box they came in is really pretty, and the colors of the panties themselves are pretty as well. I wear a size 4 US, and got a small. It fits perfectly.I love these! They came as a box set. The material has a soft and silk like feel and they never ride up! The pattern in the lace (on the back) is beautiful as well! One of the most comfortable pairs of underwear that I own. Definitely ordering another set soon. The colors were true to the images depicted on the product page, they fit better than expected and they arrived on time as well. They definitely keep me feeling sexy but I love that I don\\'t have to compromise my comfort either! Thank you!Out of 6 , 2 are smaller size , quality of part is too low . It’s like someone made it leftover cloths .A mi novia le gustó mucho y ella está muy feliz por el obsequio que le di 🙂Are cute and comfortableThey were a little small compared to other larges and it seemed certain panties were different quality then from others which was a little odd otherwise no complaints. And they all look very nice.Too small, I had to order a size larger than usualQueda como lo esperabaLoved it!fits perfectIt’s cute and comfortableFits good.

I like that there is no underwire, so it doesn\\'t cut into my body. It really is the prettiest little comfy bra I have now!!Good quality,  soft lace, and great on top. The bottoms did take me like 15 minutes to figure out how to put on, but that may be my own problem.  However, the whole that is open on the front is in a really strange spot idkFit the gf good she truly enjoyes it the too is a little bigger then expected wish you could ordered the top and bottom in separate sizes but over all great productI\\'m a 16 in the hips, C cup medium up top. Y\\'all this thing right here...it is literally string. Give yourself time put it on. Get your friend who is good with puzzles. But the top is oversized.Super cute! I’m 5’10” and 140lbs. I am a “barely B” cup, and a medium was perfect. This would be even cuter if I actually had a chest. Fabric is high quality and super soft. Definitely recommend.I order from this company often because I love their stuff, but this is one of my favorites now. I’m super busty and it’s dainty, yet supportive & sexy. The lace is really soft to the touch and it’s so flattering on. I want it in more colors & may order more!! I’m a size small/4, 34DD and a small fit great. Definitely recommend!!The quality of this set is not luxurious, but decent for the price. I don’t expect them to last a long time but they’re definitely fun to wear from time to time. I wear 32DD size bras, I find this one to be true to size; however, the only problem for me is that the shoulder straps are somewhat short even after adjustment. The panties I got are size M, they fit perfect.The first time I tried it on I was a little iffy on the fit... but after wearing it around the house it is very comfortable and pretty I\\'m happy with it.Beautiful.. but I sized up a cup and still a bit too small due to the top lace that tends to fall down would definitely buy again, will go up 1 more cup sizeNice quality,  a bit on the small side. I’m 5’3”,118, and a 32C in Victoria’s Secret. I got the 32C and it came with “medium” sized underwear... they are more like a “small “ for sure, but the quality really was pretty good.  Use caution if you are a betweener with sizes in underwearI’m totally shocked at the price, quality, and fit of these items. Both pieces fit perfectly! I’m going back to by more from this product line!!!I recieved the bra but never recieved the panties. Very disappointed. It was supposed to be for my wedding dress and now I have to find something else and settle. Which I didn’t want to have to do. The bra is perfect and I love every aspect of it. It says it is a bra AND panty SET...where is the panty that was supposed to come with it?! 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ This is why it gets only 4 stars.So so sexy. The grey color is beautiful l. The lace work stunning. It looks super expensive. Cannot wait to wait wear.Purchased for a sexy night so while I am a 36D I purchased what was close because it will only be worn for a sexy nightI love the fit, it’s the perfect push up, material on the side of the arm pit for any extra fat hanging, it already stretches but come with a bra extenderFits very well. The bottoms fit well too, but were a little high for me. I look better in low waisted panties, high waisted make my butt look long instead of round like it is. But I just shortened the back strip a little and it looks phenomenal. sent this (uncropped) to my husband at work, he damn near left early.Got a medium, I am a 34F, 140lbs and 5ft 4.Best lingerie I\\'ve purchased in a LONG time. The keyhole shape on the top is the most flattering cut I\\'ve ever worn. I\\'m 5\\'9\", 130lbs, 34C and purchased a Medium. The top fit perfectly but the bottoms were too large (they ended up looking a bit high-waisted). I went back and bought the same in all the colors.I bought this set and I was a little skeptical considering it was an online purchase. I decided to buy one size larger then my actual size just to be safe. When I tried it on, it fit perfectly! I am so in love with it! It’s extremely adorable. It came in the mail on the day of my birthday so I wore it for my boyfriend that night and he was all over me! He loved it way more then I expected and it makes me feel so confident! I love how you can wear it with a leather jacket thrown over as well. The only downside was that the panties fit just a little bit lose, so they often slide down a bit but other then that I am really happy with my order and I’m planning on buying another set in a different color.I am5\\'5 and 130lbs,36c,I got a medium and it fits perfect,it\\'s back hooked and really soft to my skin ,I pair it with a jeans and it looks great! love this lace bra set!I love how it looked the material is super comfortable it\\'s not those itchy type of lace. My husband approved.UPDATE:accidentally washed it in the washing machine and suprisingly theres no hole in it, usually when you wash these kind of lacey materials ij the washer it gets hole on it. But this one did not! AWESOME!Looks great on my wife!I wasn’t expecting much quality, but at least hoped they would fit normally.  It’s as if they assumed one hip & leg to be way larger than the other (photos for reference).  While trying it on, I kept repositioning it in the front & then again in the back, but I realized there is at least 1 inch extra slack on one side.  Super weird & definitely noticable.Also as most mentioned, they are very high-rise, not at all how pictured on the model, so I will now have to sew this in 2 spots to be decently ready for Valentine’s Day in 2 days, which isn’t that easy when lace is involved.(Edit:  since I sewed & shortened the panties by a little over 1 inch, the overal band is much too tight, as it was supposed to be distributed evenly on both sides.  Unfortunately, still unwearable.)Don’t have complaints about the bra, I’m usually a 36-38 D & weigh ~180lbs & a XL fit me, maybe a tiny bit snug so I could’ve possibly fit in a size up if I wanted)Material a little bit too thin but otherwise I am satisfied with this product. Very sexyThis is a terrific product. I purchased them for my girlfriend and she loved them. Very bright and colorful design on front and even a small I- Scream cone in full colour on the back.  I knew that she would love them and that\\'s why I bought 2 pair.  I was right.  We both are enjoying the Ice Cream underwear. They fit just right also !!!  Sorry, she said these are  just for me to enjoy,  NO pictures for you. Thank you again for such a great product. I would buy again.I really like the idea however after one use the ice cream cone came offThe Letters came off the first day I got them !Love it! Adjustable straps are great. Will be posting pics to IG @halle_hayesNot only are these adorable and comfortable, but the packaging was discreet and ADORABLE! I was blown away by the cute pink box. It\\'s absolutely a win win and you cant beat the price!This 6 Pack of Panties have colors that pair well with my bras, are comfortable, and fit as expected. They are also sexy as stated in the description and are affordable! Thank you!These came neatly packed in a pretty pink box. I like that there is a good variety of colors. The material is very soft and stretchy and they fit well. I’d definitely buy more.Super comfy and really nice panties! Great fit, theybdomt rub or move around. Great with dresses, no lines ! Love the variety of colors! Such a great price for 6pairs!Just received these today and they beautiful and so very soft. I’m impressed with the detail and quality. They are super soft and stretchy.I’m always hesitant to order underwear online, or even buy it in stores. Lol. These fit PERFECTLY. I am so pleased! Will buy again.These thongs are better than I expected. The size is real and I was excited to see that they come in so many colors. Pink is my favorite! Also, the price is so great, that I was very surprised. I usually buy just one pair at the store for the same amount. They come packaged in a really cute pink little box, that I think it’s very nice. I will probably buy more soon.Not only do these make me feel sexy, they are also comfortable. I usually wear a medium in V.S. but I ordered a large in the and they fit perfectly. I washed all of them before wearing them and they did not fade or tear. Very pleased with purchase.Love theseAs a male I\\'ve been wearing womens panties for over 10 years and these fit my body type very nicely. My bubble bottom fills out the back and the front easily covers my stuff. Lacey in the back with just enough opened to show my cheeks. Will get the pink next time for the femme look.It\\'s exacting as pictured. I\\'m a guy, but I prefer wearing feminine underwear, and my wife thought she\\'d like these on me. I typically wear a size 8 or XL in US sizes so I figured she\\'d be safe with the XXXL. If you are an 8 or larger these won\\'t fit. 3 stars for size. Everything else seemed fine.These are perfect! I feel super sexy in them. They fit great under my work clothes so I can feel secretly sexy too. They had a bit of a chemical smell when I first got them. But it came out with 1 wash.Fit great actually very comfortable, very sexy husband approved lolGot these in the mail today and they fit great. I was worried they wouldn\\'t fit because converting from women\\'s sizes to men\\'s is a nightmare. They fit nice and look really cute and they seem to be made fairly well. Definitely going to get some of these for my gf because I bet she\\'ll look a lot better in them than me! lol. If you\\'re a guy who wants to wear something like this, don\\'t be afraid to try them. I\\'m a fairly large guy but they fit me fine.Took a little while to receive..but otherwise these r my favorite!!These are unique and gorgeous and my man LOVES them. Above all else, they are truly comfortable!I have many different pairs of these type of panties, and I love this pair\\xa0It\\'s really as beautiful as the picture, without any color difference, the quality looks better than the picture.I bought it for my wonderful bae, she was very happy and u get the exact size, what u ordering- so as she told me she like the quality and it’s areally sexy stuffSuper cute and comfy. The lace is stretchy and it is exactly as pictured. Hopefully i can find more of this stretchy lace. Fits well and is gorgeous.Supper sexy just need to buy stockings but without it you will still be fine! Definitely don’t size up the material is stretchy so you’ll be fine will be definitely purchasing more products from this company!Love this brand so much. It\\'s well made and the stitching is beautifully done. I wasn\\'t sure if this would run small but it fits perfectly! I am 36DD and 170 pounds.  This purple lingerie set is so gorgeous and sexy.So super sexy ladies! Phew! I took a moment to properly give this garment the official try. Wash like all your special stuff, but actually held up on an accidental washer cycle beautifully. Ties in the back for band width, very accommodating cup for a change! I’m a 34 D women’s size 2 pants, small top medium coat.. fits nice and very hot. Can’t beat the price.I am a small size, it is still very suitable, the elasticity is very good, the size can be adjusted, very intimate, the color is as beautiful as the pictureWhen my friend showed her lingerie, her other friends got jealous. So I decided to order some more for the other two friends and give them as a gift. She liked it and told me that it was the bra and panty fitted very nicely and garter belt was strong enough to attach to stocking. Overall, she finds it comfortable and had lots of fun with it.I got these panties in exchange for an HONEST review, and honest I will be...  these are actually WONDERFUL!!  The material on these panties is FABULOUS... they fit JUST as the size chart specifies. And I received these SO FAST.  I am impressed all around.  They are super super cute.  The lace in the back make them still sexy even though they are a full sized panty.  And the rest of the material is not the kind that will leave you with little elastic strings hanging that when you pull it, the whole panty unravels... no..this is quality. Love them!This underwear is so soft and silky fitting! I accidentally ordered a size smaller than I usually wear and they fit great! I\\'m a bigger lady and it is hard to find underwear that fits well, is comfortable, and is actually pretty without paying a fortune for a flimsy pair that doesnt hold up well. These are well made, very comfortable, and very pretty! I highly recommend these underwear!OMG these are the sexiest panties ever... And I gotta belly...IT COVERS IT WITH NO ROLL UNDER...BABY LET ME TELL YOU... I WANT MORE COLORS...These are absolutely exactly as pictured - for better or for worse - in all their granny panty glory!  They would be a bit sexier if they were all sheer lace (and lacked that satiny panel in the front) and if the waistband was totally seamless (and lacked the thick elastic band that shows through and may dig in).  But the raw seamless edges around the legs and sheer rear do help with the sexy factor.  They are flattering, incredibly soft, and very comfortable!  But I am a 99.9% thong wearer - so I can\\'t compare them to any sort of full coverage bikini brief type item.  The lace has a nice stretch to it and doesn\\'t feel cheap or itchy.  The crotch liner (95% cotton/5% spandex - NOT 100% cotton, as stated) is white on all colors (black, navy, pink, nude, white) in my pack, which is a fail for me.  Sometimes you need a good black granny panty during that time of the month - and with white lining, just no.  Plus, the lining is way too low, like, at the butt and doesn\\'t protect lady parts.  So far, they do very well in the laundry (machine wash, dry flat).  I was fully expecting them to be too big since I really am an XXS, but they fit reasonably well with the stretch.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4, as they are well-priced.Good quality, soft fabric and lace. I accidentally ordered a small for some reason when I should have ordered a medium. Old habits I suppose. I am 5’4. 120 lbs, 28in waist and 38in hips. The smalls do fit me kind of snugly but not too small to where I cannot wear them. They aren’t cutting into me or anything. But they are not as high waisted as the photo shows. They kind of look like just normal bikini cut panties when on. I think that’s because I ordered the small and I needed the medium. And what the heck is with the WHITE cotton gusset in these black panties? My period will destroy this. Might as well just reach in my underwear drawer on my heaviest flow day and choose the whitest underwear I have. Other than all that I like them. I think I’ll just keep them instead of exchanging them because I tried one on and that’s just gross to return. Even tho I only wore it for maybe 30 seconds. Still. I wouldn’t want to purchase panties that a stranger already wore. But if were to order these again I would for sure get a medium. And if I end up liking these enough to where I wear them a lot in my regular rotation, I’ll probably sew a black cotton gusset in myself, so I can wear them any day of the month :)I just receive my new undies in the mail and I was very excited. The underwear looks beautiful at 1st sight but the material is extremely thin and there are not  any seams or elastic for the leg openings. I am not sure they can even be washed which they have to be because they have a chemical odor. The colors are gorgeous and vibrant.  I am disappointed. I hope they feel better on.Wasn\\'t what I expected. Not enough elastic in legs (tend to crawl up) they are beautiful thoughOrdered my panties and received them today. Couldn\\'t wait to try them on! The material is nice and the, colors are fantastic! But they are a bit small. Oreded a 2x since I usually wear a 10 in unders. They fit pretty small. They would not be for daily wear. Great of I plan to wear them to look pretty 😉. I guess I\\'ll make them a gift to someone.Do not order this! It’s nothing like the picture. The fabric was like shiny clown costume material, the top was scrunchy with elastic all along the bottom, and the bottoms were huge and high waisted, more diaper-like.Love itI really liked these. They are comfortable and sexy, but not really durable enough for daily wear,more just for fun!Hello the panties are a little small, but I bought this mostly for the sheer bra.  This fits nicely, and like the way it show my breasts.  Also love how the sheer stimulates my nipples.  WOW what a great price, thank you.Nice set. Runs small. I wear 38D, which is what I ordered but it was too small. Will return and order a size up. Very sheer (transparent).I got this in my normal size, 38c. The top was just a bit snug, as well as the bottoms. Not unwearable, just snug. I bought again in a different style and color & went up to a 40c. This did the trick! Both the top and bottoms fit much better.  I love them & will certainly be purchasing more in different colors.My boyfriend really loves it. This was exactly what I was looking for. None of that hard padding that make your breasts feel like softballs when hugging. This has a soft natural look and feel. The best part is that, I felt so sexy even though I was wearing normal clothes, it was like a little secret no one knew but me. I always heard from my girl friends that buying lingerie for yourself is so soothing and such a confidence boost, but feeling it for myself is a whole other level of delightful. Oh, and yes, your boyfriend or husband will love this one hundred percent, maybe even more than you ??These run really small.  My wife wears a Large and I had to order XXL.  Incredible color!I like the bra.  It fits nicely.  My reason for the 4 stars is only because of the cut of the bra.  I knew that when I purchased it, so it is not any fault of the seller.  I was just hoping the cut wasn\\'t like most bras that are cut that way.  It fits great, and I plan on wearing it.As reviews suggested buy up a band size, I’m a 38D but ordered a 40D, fits perfect! Very sexy bra, does exactly what it’s supposed to! Didn’t try the panties yet but can’t wait!I normally wouldn\\'t write a review for underwear, but I absolutely had to for these! I have tried 2 or 3 different kinds from Amazon, (since I gave up on VS due to quality and $$) but couldnt find any I really loved. Then I came across Mae. I am so happy with this purchase I am buying more! 95% cotton (truly), and the lace is SO soft!!! I am usually a M in VS thongs, but I ended up getting a large and they fit perfectly! I\\'m 5\\'7, 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 in jeans. The quality of these is AMAZING and I dont feel like the lace is going to rip after a week lol! If you are sick of VS and like cotton, hello Mae!!!!👍😍I\\'m normally a US size 6 or medium. I went ahead and sized up just in case and wound up with 3 different sizes. No, they weren\\'t labeled as such. The trim of the width and length of the \"crotch area\" varied in every pair, and the waist band on one out of 3 was much looser than the other 2.  One pair, fits perfectly.I really like the material and the style though, so I\\'m going to order a size medium next and see if I have better luck.Will update.UPDATE: Love these in a medium. They are very delicate but stretchy and flattering. Don\\'t SIZE UP! They\\'re true to American sizes and stretchy enough to be a little forgiving if you\\'re between sizes.Very nice thongs.  Have a very large underwear collection (BoutineLA, WT, VS) but these have definitely earned their way into the regular rotation.Not sure how durable the lace waistband is, but they’ve made it a few washes with no problems.Will probably end up buying more in different colors.Just received these today. Was tired of paying a ridiculous amount for nicer name-brand panties, or cheaping out on uncomfortable inexpensive ones. Best part is these guys actually fit. A lot of thongs I tend to buy in my supposed size rise up so high I feel like I should be in Baywatch (which isn\\'t always bad, but they\\'re never the right cut to compliment that.), lol. The actual cotton panty part sits low enough to compliment the stretchy lace band while not sitting ridiculously high on my hips. Will definitely be looking at more of your products again, thanks!Very comfortable. No-show under leggings. And COTTON (except for the lace) which is so hard to find. I am buying more. Recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. I am a size 10 and got these in large. They fit perfectly but if they stretch out AT ALL over time they will be too big. I may try a MI have several thongs that are a similar style from other stores, so when I saw these at a great price, I figured I didn\\'t have anything to lose! And I was right! I generally wear medium size underwear, and I ordered a medium, and the fit is excellent! The only reason I\\'m not giving five stars is because the elastic in the black pair started to fray after a couple washes. Not a deal breaker, and no one will notice but me, but still not quite five-star quality. Definitely worth the price!Fit is fine and they wash up nice...air dryThese are cute and just as described but they run quite small. I\\'d recommend order 1 to 2 sizes up depending on your shape. I ordered these in large based on reviews stating they run small and I compared them to my Victoria Secret size medium underwear of the same style (cotton crotch, lace top) and the large is still smaller than the VS medium!Love this set! Great value for the money. If I had one qualm, it would be that the thigh-high stockings are too tight, but all things considered, I can always go out and purchase a black pair to complete the set, and I do have larger thighs, so I kind of expected it. The bra is my exact size: 34C and can be adjusted. You don’t get to pick the underwear size, I’m guessing they throw in a pair based on your bra size, so I’m glad I got what seems to be a medium. Overall, I’m very happy and will be using the bra and underwear only until I can find replacement thigh-highs.Well, nothing fit for the wife. She’s a 38D and is 5ft 5 inch so she got the 38D. The second she opened it, she said “these cups are for an ‘A’”. Can’t share a picture cause you’ll see literally EVERYTHING. she needed to get it off it was so uncomfortable. It was like trying to cover her with a small leaf, nips showing and all. Garter didn’t fit, stockings definitely didn’t, and the underwear was tight. We thought it was a joke, but the package says 38D. As for the quality, the lacing kept scrunching up to where it was nonexistent on everything—bra straps, under bra, etc. It came all smashed up in a bag. Go to a local store so you can try on spend the extra money for better quality.The bra is beautiful, super feminine, very pretty and comfortable, it fit perfect and was true to size. Just like in the picture and it makes you feel very sexy.  I\\'m impressed. It\\'s a very wide band with multiple hooks so unless you have someone to help you, you can always hook in front then gently twist to the back. The straps are adjustable and not too long. The underwire of the cup fit me perfectly under and around my boob so I didn\\'t experience any pinching or stabbing in the side. I employ the \"swoop and scoop\" method when donning a bra; my girls fit very neatly in the front of the bra with no spilling over the top or sides of the front while at the same time giving a nice push up. The middle front of the bra pulls together very nicely and comfortably. I like the triangle cut-out in front as it makes it look a bit different than other bras. On me, the wide lace on the sides of the bra lays nice and flat with no tugging or rolling up.All in all,  I will likely buy this again in another color soon!The stockings were a little tight but over all I love it!Bra and panties fit well, i have a little extra in the middle so the middle piece was slightly tight but is somewhat adjustable (3 hooks like a bra) so it still works. The stockings arent great for thick thighs but again, still work. Really a great product for the price, super soft material. Would recommend.Overall I am pleased with the set. My main complaint is that they did not include an option for a change in panty size. So for example, I have a large bra size but a small panty size. The order required is based on the bra size; so the panties that came are way too big.I am 5\\'2\", 36DD and wear a size 8. I ordered the 36DD and the bra fit wonderfully. It has an elastic lace band that keeps your bust in. Its not enough support or coverage for daily use, but get for lingerie use. The underwear fit as expected and is comfortable on. The stockings are \"free size\", so they didn\\'t come passed my knees, if you are a size 5 or smaller it should be fine. The garter is about a size too small for me (28 waist, the set comes in a size L when you order the 36DD), and I contacted the seller and they were very quick and did everything they could to help me.I was hesitant to buy a full set, since I have particularly gifted bust and hip sizes and have a hard time getting things that really fit right. When this came in, though, it was absolutely perfect! It fits like it was made for me. It\\'s really good quality, too, and I didn\\'t feel like it was about to fall apart or anything. If you\\'re short and curvy like me, it fits you great if you get the size you would usually wear!I normally wear a 6 or 7 in other brands.  I am 5\\'6 145 lbs, athletic but not curvy so I ordered the Large.  The quality is not bad, but they were very small for me.  I would need at least an XL.  And the front panel is cut very low and skimpy.  Sending them back.Fit is okay. I just wish I looked into the description better. These have an elastic band along the top which I don\\'t care for at all and they sit a lot higher than I\\'m used to (I must buy low rise normally) and frequently show above some of my pants.Different materials used for different colors. The nice soft stretchy material is great. The thick woven cotton sucks and can be seen on all clothes. They are a bit smaller, so if your used to a medium at VS then these pinch. Nice construction but ouch.I had ordered a large, package said large, but goofy me washed them and noticed I received small. Like the looks and quality. Just check the size when you get them. I would  return the undies  but since I washed them.....would have given them a 5.These seem a little small for me as I am 4\\'11\" and 98lbs. However, I am a little hippie so that could be why they are a little tight. I ordered the small and next time I will get the mediums. They seem well made and are very cute for sure.Some colors not as described. Some fit good, others too tightGood fit looks greatToo small....The quality was good but the sizes were not accurate at all.....returned.I needed more coverage then the thongs that give you a FRONT wedgie if ya know what I mean...these stay in place perfectly and don’t slide around. I think they run small and they do shrink a tad in the dryer. I’m 5’7, 165lbs, and have wide hips. Im usually a size large but I got an XL in these so nothing squeezes into my hips causing lines, and they fit flawlessly. They are not seem less but I wear leggings and they don’t stand out much. Will definitely be buying another pack!It\\'s oddly difficult to find cotton thong underwear in stores, everything is polyester (bleh) so I took to Amazon to find some and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these since they\\'re so inexpensive. They were packaged neatly in a sealed bag, didn\\'t have a weird smell like some fabrics from Amazon tend to have and they fit like a dream. I\\'m a size 12-14 and the XL is comfortable as hell.  Definitely would recommend!I have worn three pairs now and I have to say that these are awesome! And the price can\\'t be beat!.... its hard finding cottong underwear in thongs that come in a pack antwhere in store so finding these online was a win!I wear a size 27 pants and ordered a large and they fit great. The medium would have been a little snug.I absolutely LOVE these panties so far! I battle-tested one pair by wearing it to the gym and working out intensely for 3 hours. They didn\\'t slip, chafe, or get stuck where they weren\\'t supposed to get stuck. On top of that, the material was breathable and I didn\\'t smell like plastic afterwards. Definitely recommend these to women who have an active lifestyle and still want to look cute.They fit okay. I bought one size up from what I usually wear because the reviews said they run large. I don\\'t really like the design though, in person it kind of looks frumpy. I will still wear them because they\\'re fairly comfortable but these are not \"sexy panties\" for sure.They are comfy and provide the coverage I prefer. I am an active weightlifter and fitness enthusiast. So I wear workout clothing everyday. Love the color combo, quality, and fitI got an extra large. I have a large behind and it fits perfect on my waist. Good quality material. The elastic is very comfortable it feels like you are not wearing anything. The fit in the back is like a Brazilian hang lighter fit (medium triangle) so it looks really good.  I will be buying more.This is the 2nd pack I bought. First small pack I bought with another small pack to test out durability. The Emprella lasted, the other brand busted at the seems. So I bought this product again in a larger package size. They are comfy, dont shrink. Have not yet had a fray, or tear. They have lasted longer than any of my other thongs. Love them ! Thank you.These are very thin almost silk but basically just like any other regular store cotton briefs don\\'t provide.  They are not as high waisted as expected and have NO tummy control other than they go over your tummy.  There\\'s no elastic or stretch to them making them tummy controlled.  I would return but i\\'d lose out $6 for shipping.  I might as well just keep them and buy a different kind.  (In the picture, these barely went over my belly button.)I guess if you don\\'t have fat rolls these would be fine.These are the most comfortable panties for women needing a high leg and waist panty.  They have no pant lines, they wash well, they are cotton crotched.  They run true to size.  They are great for no butt, no waist women as well.These briefs are really comfortable and yet they are a substantial enough material that they will last. They almost feel like they have a little tummy control. They really are no show which works for me. Will be buying another color palate. Great price!Extremely well made - very simple - no elastic bands to show through clothing, but still does not ride-up!  Full coverage, but doesn\\'t feel or look like \"granny-panties\"!  Fabric has a wonderful feel - launders beautifully.  Could not be happier!SERIOUSLY THE BEST PANTIES ON THE PLANET! Unmatched comfort - no sliding or rolling down. Breathability - so your lady bits don\\'t feel trapped. No panty lines or wedgies - and I\\'m notorious for constantly picking my wedgies. Perfect for running, hiking & playing softball....I\\'d assume most other sports/physical activities as well. They also hold in / smooth / control  your tummy area if it likes to be a tad unruly - although they are by no means shapewear. I continued to wear maternity panties for years because of my c-section incision...those days are long gone with these new found gems.Ohhhhhhhh and the value, I did not expect to love them this much after paying only $15!!YOU.WILL.NOT.REGRET.TRYING.THESE.BABIES.OUT.I love these underwear i look for this kind quite often because with a csection scar you cant go wrong with these. On top of it dont exactly feel like you wearing underwear at all. The only thing that upset me was i order a pack of 5 and received a package of 4, with a sticker on the bag that says 5.These are some of the most comfortable panties I have ever own.  I like them so much that I have ordered a second set.  My only comment is that the leg holes are a little big for my legs (not sure is I have skinny legs  are they are supposed to be that way).  It doesn\\'t bother me because they are so comfortable.I love the fit, the fabric and the height that does not ad to a muffin top on Mom Jeans.Happy wife, happy Life:-) Here\\'s her thoughtsThese are quite comfy and really turn my man on. Here\\'s what I like:Pros:  Comfy  Great colors  Access hole is very big  Nice lace for the priceAnd here\\'s what I don\\'t like:Cons:  easy to rip or snag  Rolls up if you have a tummyI\\'m a plus sized lady so finding fun sexy clothing can sometimes be a little challenging, but he got it right with these:-) I love teasing him when we\\'re at the store shopping and I\\'ve got on my sundress or when he gets the car door for me and I get in/out side saddle giving him an \"eye-full\" :-)Needless to say we\\'re both quite happy:-)Super sexy and fit as expected. However, for being \"crotchless\" they covered a good deal of \"crotch\". With a pair of seam rippers, I made necessary adjustments, but I wish they were a little more practical for \\'rushed encounters\\'.AMAZINGThese are great.  Just order a size or two up.  I usually wear L/XL but ordered a six XL a little too big but wearable.  Really like them.Quedo prefectoGreat. Exactly as shown. Fit as expected. Really liked these.Great buy. The only thing is the ruffle seems to fit in the front which kind of looks weird but still looks sexy!Pay attention to the product description. I sized up due to bra size. Very sexy piece. Bottom piece is definitely for appearance and not for coverage 🙈 Highly recommend buying the thigh high hose to complete the look. 👌🏼I almost sized up but I\\'m glad i didn\\'t my normal size fits great. I\\'m 38C and have wide hips. Size large fits me. The lace has a nice wavy design on the breasts and the lace is nice quality.Fit was slightly lacking in the chest area but very forgiving in the bottom portion. The bottom portion does a good job covering loose skin from weight loss. I wear a 40F bra so recommend up your size to be safe. Good fabric. Very pretty pattern/color in person than in photo. And as it mentions in description no stockings are included.This is a great thing to wear if you want to change things up.  When your man comes back from work and you surprise him wearing this, thing will get... \"fun\".  Definitely is a change in pace in things if you wear this.  I highly recommend if you want to give him a gift, or if you are buying this for your girl, give yourself the gift ;) .  Can\\'t go wrong with this, can only go right.  How right is up to you lol.Have fun, enjoy, I know we did.I love this bralette set! And so did my boyfriend! It fit as expected and the color is beautiful.  The material is streachy and soft. The  design/cutout of the top is tasteful and seductive. Perfect dress up bedroom outfit.This would be a great product for people looking to have a little bit of fun! My only issue with it is that I’m not quite busty enough to fill out the top. This is also not the kind of thing I regularly wear, so I’m not really used to the fabric. But it was good quality and my fiancé enjoyed it.This fit my petite girlfriend surprisingly well! She’s 5’1” with a shorter than average torso, but was able to adjust the straps perfectly. The material wasn’t uncomfortable at all. She looked great in it. Definitely true to size and worth the buy!\\xa0This outfit makes me feel so sexy. My husband said thank you for the present. It’s made so good (even though didn\\'t last long). The colors are vibrant.Runs smallwifeThe material is very stretchable so there can be no cutting in. Do not size up. I am 5\\'6 and on me the small is too much material to call sexy. It is slightly sexy since it is mostly see-through. A daily panty but not a date night panty unless you are a briefs woman.Super sexy on my wife. She loves them too. Not the best quality but they’re probably gonna get ripped off in the heat of passion they will bring on.The fabric feels nice, I will admit that, however it was thinner then needed to be, the edges were cut like a child had cutter them and didn’t even feel nice. They need to either lower the price to what it looks like it’s worth, 99¢, or do a better job with it’s quality.Atleast it’s an easy return so I’m not mad, just a little let down.Perfect fit. Felt great on. Extremely flattering. The guy looooved it. (140lbs. 5\\'5\")It fit, but not well enough to prevent rolling. Cute though.So these are cute but don’t seem to be very well made. They’re stretchy, which is nice, but the threads immediately began coming undone as I stretched them, and I was not over-stretching them. So all in all, cute but cheap, not worth $8Utterly useless. These don\\'t even have finished edges of any elasticity. Don\\'t waste your money.Great for travel. Keep a pair in your makeup bag for emergency.I had a great time......Soft and stretchy, I\\'m a 16 and the 2x size fit great.and like the log said every body did it , waist 38Letter super big...doesnt look very sexy...more like a billboard...Adorable panties. Soft cotton. Way too small. I wear a large from Victoria Secret and ordered an XL in these. They definitely did not fit 🤦\\u200d♀️These fit perfect I’m a size 8/10 in jeans and bought a large. My husband loves them.Super Sexy!they look good on herIf, like me, you transcend male normative gender norms you are going to love these panties. I went with the medium (5,9 150lbs) and they fit perfectly. Perfect coverage front and back. Super, super shiny and slippery! I\\'ve ordered gold and pink but pretty sure I\\'ll be ordering in many more colors. Worth the price--great quality and nice details.I ordered this  black pair for myself to try them out and I liked them and they  fit really comfortable. So I just ordered a royal blue pair too and I expect to order more colors  later on.Update, I ordered the gold pairIt fits nicely and feels good.  Although I would order a size up, since they run a bit small.  Other than that, I\\'m happy.Very soft and silky and extremely sexy.Love them very softLooks sexy and feeks good on the skinToo small for my normal size girlfriendVery comfortable to wear.I’m 4’11” and 94 lbs. I usually wear a size 00 or a size xxs. I’m a 32b and my small chest and waist make finding lingerie hard but this fit perfect. It’s really sexy and the xs is perfect for smaller people.The colors are so rich and vibrant. I am in love with my emerald color set. It\\'s truly beautiful.  These panties are insanely comfortable and just gorgeous.  The top was a bit tricky for me because I need a medium bottom but an extra large top. I obviously can\\'t do that with online orders so I had to go with large and the top is a bit skimpy on my, larger than average, boobs. It\\'s not a deal breaker however as I love it. It\\'s just not very functional. It\\'s a gorgeous set to show off tho and my husband was speechless when I showed him. That\\'s a good thing!! LOL I absolutely adore this set and if the top fit just a smidge better I would say this was perfection. It is well made and just gorgeous. Also, very comfy with perfect stretching.Such a pretty set. The top was a little small, on the cup part of the bra. Not the bands that go around your back and chest. Those are ribbon and adjustable. However, I am a c-d cup and this set is not supposed to be full coverage. Just a heads up for anyone with a larger cup size ;-) Another tip is on the bottom, the side with the tag is the front. (Usually the tag is on the back of the garment right? So why not on this?) The side of the bottom with the seam in the back. This information might save you some time. I put it on backwards at first and the bottoms didn’t fit properly until i took them off and tried the other way. Trust me, it will look and feel really funny if you put them on wrong 😂After I got in one correctly, it fit well and looked cute. I’m 5’8, 148 pounds so I got a medium. The only reason why I put runs a little small was because the cup part of the bra was a little small for my size.The pink color is really romantic. It feels nicer than the price would suggest. the panties are pretty great, flattering, and true to size. the top does run small. Size small just fits me, and I have a 26\" underbust. The whole cut of the bra is awkward and requires a lot of fiddling to make it look right. Once I had it on, I felt good in it. The bra is just puzzling and I will definitely wear the underwear more.Top was a bit small, bottoms fit perfectly. Very sexy! I wear the underwear more often. The top was for a photoshoot and looked nice!For $13 these are great! The underwear don\\'t have a lining at all so I don\\'t think I\\'d want to wear them all day, but the bralette is amazing! Fits well and looks super cute. It\\'s probably not the most well made bralette ever, but for such a cheap price it\\'s perfect.Not too bad for the price because Im in love with the lace, bows, color and qualoty of the fabric & all of the materials used. The top is my main issue because the straps have zero support for my chest, but I guess thats with a lot of things when you have a DD chest. I got this for a weekend cabin getaway and it\\'s perfect that the bottoms are almost like a bathing suit material so it\\'ll work perfectly in the jacuzzi!Too big, threads ripped and strings loose. I want a refund! Do not buy. I am a 34 b and small was too big for me. Undies are literally a cheap peice of lace sewn on to an elastic band. One strut and one of your cheeks will be busting out of there like a cowboy in a casino. Stay away from this. You have been warned...I was a little uncertain when I pulled it out the package, but it\\'s actually a very cute little lace set. It\\'s a little weird how it\\'s long in the front and very short in the back. I would rather it be an even length all the way around. Its soft and the top is supportive.A very sexy set! The fit was perfect. The fabric is comfortable against skin. This is a very nice set of sexy lingerie. Great fit,love the color.Loved this set so much I ordered the nude one also. It looks amazing 😉I really love this outfit. The color is a really deep wine and the cut of the top is really flattering and unique. I LOVE the bottoms. They were so comfortable I wore them all day long when I tried it on.The material is very soft ,the product is very comfortable overall ...will definitely be ordering back in different colorsThe lace is beautiful looking and soft the straps are removable from both sides if you ever need to take them off. I should\\'ve gone a full cup size up though.Ordered a small and fits great after tightening the straps. For the price its the best teddy I\\'ve found. VERY comfy and flattering. Ordering in more colors soon!The small set fit me really well. I like that the bra can be adjusted with the straps, so I you can have larger or smaller breasts, and it will look good.I was happily surprised with this product. I bought it for the bra. I like it, it looks great. It fits great. It is relatively comfortable for a push-up bra. The underwear bottom is a little tight on me, but I have a big bottom compared to the size of my top. I usually buy separates. Still fits, I would have just liked Large instead of Medium underwear, but that\\'s what automatically came with the 34-B bra...I wanted to love this. And I did love the panties. They fit good and the color is great. But the top is way small. I ordered bigger than my size and I was spilling out (sides, front, top) of the cups. They band is definitely too skinny for the cup sizes listed.I love it, fits as I hoped it would. I\\'m very pleased with the set.This fit well and is flattering.  Also the material is soft.Great fit, looks expensive.❤️Good fit and support.The material was nice, but it ran kind of small.This set is lovely and the bra fits true to size. However, I knocked off one star because the panties are quite small in comparison to the bra (or perhaps I just have a larger bottom section!) It would be nice to be able to specify the size of the panties when ordering. Still a good buy for the price and a very pretty set.The bra was lovely and fit as I expected a 38C to fit...with a band extender....at least it matched.  The panty, however, would maybe fit my 10 yr-old grand-daughter.....Proportion counts, people...had to get my $$ backThe bra set I ordered is 34B. I received more like a 34C, and the panty is an xsmall. Then they cut out the information from the bra and the panty. Would not order again.Had for 2 days and loved it until the underwire broke thru ... spend the extra money and buy name brand!  Plus the panties fit my 8 year old... not me!!!!! BVery comfortable and beautifulfit perfectly!!so comfortable and sexy...I love it!!Love the fit and color.LovelySuper snug fit. Sexy as ever. It’s not geared for short waisted women. The torso section is rather long. But it’s incredibly sexy.I wore this top to a tight and shiny event.  I paired it with a skirt of the same style/look. It held up the whole night of fun. I got lots of compliments.  It moved well with my body which I wasn’t sure it would.  I got XXL. Remember it will fit tighter as it should.....you buy at least one size larger than what you usually get. I am 5’5 115lbs and usually wear a small in everything. I bought the medium and it was very, very snug. Once I squeezed myself in I thought it would be a one time use and it would need to be cut off. Surprisingly I got it on (and it looked amazing) and off without ripping it. Can’t wait to wear this again.XXL not even close to fitting.  I bought this for my gal as a gift (for me).  She usually wears XXL.  I guess I should have paid more attention to their size chart.  Their chart shows an XXL fitting a 33\" bust (!) versus a 42\" bust.  She said that it was at least four inches too short too (she is 5\\'10\").  Too bad, it looked good!I love the quality / fabric but it does run really small. I\\'m 5\\'2 & 138- 140. I purchased the large but should of gotten the XL.  Once I lose another 10 lbs it\\'ll fit perfectly.This fit tight and looked right except it is short in the torso or isn\\'t meant for large chests even at the largest size because the neck pulls down unflatteringly, more like a necklace than a chokerIt fits a little snug, so really check your measurments. It\\'s very flattering on the curves. Take your time getting into it.This is really well made for what it is. Better than most in its price rangeI like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitLove it!  I\\'m 5\\'3\" 145 lbs. It was a little snug at first but after loosening up the back it fit perfectly!As with most items on Amazon, follow the size chart, it\\'s there for a reason. I am 5\\'4\" on a good day, and wear a 1X in most women\\'s clothes, or a 16W. I ordered a 5X because it made sense according to the chart. It fit well with the usual corset adjustments, loosening laces, putting it on and closing it up, then the final lace tightening.Unlike those lucky women who are curvy and beautiful, I am lumpy and frumpy. Think apple rather than pear. Only the apple has gone mushy. Looking for a way to dress up the old apple, I took a deep breath and ordered this corset based on the reviews. Given the price and knowing it wasn\\'t bone, I must admit that I wasn\\'t expecting much but figured I wasn\\'t throwing away that much money if it wasn\\'t what I wanted.I was pleasantly surprised, it was quite lovely. The red color was bright but rich and not cheesy at all, and the pattern was pretty. I quietly ducked into the closet just to try it on. As it was my first corset ever, I struggled with it for a little while but applying a bit of common sense really went a long way. I was red-faced from my struggles but not entirely unhappy with the overall result. I took it off and tucked it in a drawer and forgot about it.A few weeks later, when I was at home on a vacation day and the hubby at work, I thought I\\'d give it another go. I had bought a garter belt and stockings at the same time as this corset, and along with a pair of heels I\\'d never worn before but were very sexy, I managed to get myself all dolled up for my first ever selfie shoot. I kid you not when I say that this corset made me feel so much better about myself because it smoothed out my trouble spots and made even my mushy apple body look amazing. I even felt so new and exciting that I sent a few of the pics to the unsuspecting husband at work. He LOVED it, and I felt wonderful.I\\'ve since purchased two more in other colors and styles, just waiting for the right time to wear them. It is not an exaggeration to say that this little inexpensive item I bought on a whim a few weeks ago actually changed my life.Never really owned a corset before but I have to say this one was really good. Fit good and looked really sexy. I am now shopping for more. Husband loved it.I got a Medium. I am 5\\'1 and 140 pounds & I wear a 36D bra. It\\'s very pretty, it\\'s strings loosen and tighten in the back very very well. The bf just loved this, it\\'s a great buy. So so pretty fits great and great price. A corset and thong were included and it arrived on time. Love this!This is SO beautiful. I was waiting for the right occasion, and our anniversary was even better! It was a little difficult to get on, but worth the trouble! I am 5\\'6\" 180 lbs,  ordered 2x, and felt like $1 million in this little number!I ordered according to size charts. I wear a us size 8 or medium. I ordered an xl. It fit perfectly right out of the box. Beautiful, sexy. I am happy with the purchase!Love it. its a little lose for my top i wear a 5\\'7 , 36D im about 190lb. it fits great. if you want it more snug id go down a size. material is great and it was a little hard to buckle in front. I tighten the strings as much as they would go and still a little loser on top then i want. But other then that no complaints. Im keeping it because it does fit and my top doesn\\'t fall out so its wearable.Loving it! Hugs my curves, lifts my breasts and makes me feel so sexy <3 Favorite color too :)These run a wee bit small if you have a generous bottom.  I\\'m a solid size 4 in Gap or Old Navy clothes, little waist, bubble butt.  Ordered medium first but it was too tight.  Gave it to a friend, ordered large, it\\'s perfect.  Husband lost his damn mind when he saw these.  Coupled it with a cage bra, nearly killed him.Just enough opening for air flow or hanky panky with a hand or tongue. Wearing these brings out my sensual side.If you like taking her from behind, you\\'ll love these panties.They feel like regular bikinis, size is right on.  I don’t like thongs or g-stings.  I bought one of these to try.  We liked it so much, I bought more in different colors. I wear these most of the time now.  We like my ass being bare.  Always ready for sensuous quick grabs and back door sex.  Hands, finger, tongue, other male parts slide in quickly, no need to undress. I wear a lot more gathered skirts since I got these!  Or, just a bathrobe!  Hint:  If you’re wearing a skirt, skip the panty hose. If you must wear nylons, wear a garter belt, so you’re ready for a quickie; at the office, parties,  in the car, on a plane, kitchen, or when kids/ mom and dad are in next room asleep or  watching tv.  More exciting, quick sex on the sly without getting caught! Kind of like being a teen in a car again.Just don’t make a lot of noise and no one will be the wiser.  These don’t work for front door.  What I like about these is that the fabric covers areas where you drip, so your outer clothing is protected.  However, sometimes,  I’ve put in liners because I get wet down there just thinking about what these will do for me.  Like right now as I’m doing this review.  Sofshie is a good brand.  I’ve been happy with everything I’ve purchased. Alternate these with the open crotch, front door models that they make.  That said, you can plan ahead for which door  you wish to use. You can keep it a surprise; imagine what fun it will be to decide in advance which game YOU want to play and surprise your partner with what YOU want and how YOU want to play.Super soft I got size m Iam 5\\'5 146I paired it with my forever 21 bra and It looks perfectDecent quality for the price. I am 5\\'4 and 160 pounds, size 10ish. I got the large and it fits around the waist and hips, but the vertical fabric strips in the back are not long enough.It fit perfectly! It breathes well, and isn\\'t particularly scratchy like some lace. It makes the button look great. Only thing is it isn\\'t what I expected. It leaves the butt open, but the vagina is completely covered. I just figured the opening extended to the front side. I will buy more from the seller.These are BEAUTIFUL. I am big in the thigh/hip region and I was worried they wouldn\\'t fit but they were perfect. The panties are sturdy but soft and obviously SEXY AS HELL. You won\\'t be disappointed.For reference: I\\'m 5.5, 130 lbs and 36D. I got a small and it fits greatHonestly not worth almost $14.. however, it was cheap. Can definitely tell it was cheaply made. A lot of extra thread and lace that needed to be trimmed off. The belt doesn\\'t exactly sit well because the elastic pulls it down just in the places it\\'s attached. And the top was definitely too big. However, not returning because I was thankfully able to cut and see the areas that needed work. After making alterations to it, it ends up looking nice. Be aware if you aren\\'t ready to fix it up in places.It was exactly as the picture showed it. I got the red one. ( will add pictures later ) i just wish i knew how to wear it 😭I got an extra large in the black one with underwire because I’m a 36D and the bra looks like a kids sized bra lol. The other pieces were great and I’ll use them, except for the bra. If you have large breasts don’t buy.Fits just right.Looks nice. Won\\'t last long. Serves purpose.  Good deal.Cute! Had a hard time putting this on though but all in all this is gorg. LovePerfect! Has adjustable strapsFabric and style were good. Sizes run small. Order up at least one size.nanI am not thrilled with these.Pros:1) Fabric feel is really nice and very comfortable.Cons:1) They roll up the leg.2) They cause wedgies often.3) They are already fraying in the elastic band after washing once.4) The cut of the panties, especially along with groin, are cut more like Men\\'s underwear and are not as cute as I had hoped them to be.Way more cons than pros. I won\\'t be purchasing these again. I can do better out there and these are not cute or sexy as the name implies.These boy shorts are clearly just that. They are obviously mens boxer briefs that they just added extra material In The crotch and market them to women. The problems with this is mens shorts are made with more room in front and less in the back because of the way a mans body is shaped. They are NOT made to fit a womans body so when I put them on they went way too high in the front and very low in the back. They even have stitching in the front that was made for a mans package. Unless you are shaped like a man and have a belly and no rear end these wont fit. I did give them 2 stars of love because the material is very soft.I would give this pants a 5 for style, 5 for fit and 5 for fabric. The problem is that after one washing I had to repair the seams on 3 of the 6 because they were unraveling!  This conjures up pictures of a sweatshop where the workers are paid so poorly they don\\'t have time to finish the seams correctly!  So I\\'ll try to find the same kind of product from a different source....these fit fine; however, why would you have nude or white undergarments with a black band? Usually the point is to not be able to see them under your light colored clothing right?  I sent them back.Just opened this package and was surprised by the range of quality.  The black pairs look fine, grey/khaki pair only has one or two noticeable flaws but the white one has terrible stitching and the beige one- oof!  The stamp is crooked, the cut is awful and the stitching is messy.  Positive side is that the sizing is good and the material feels soft. I have not washed these nor even tried them on.  I tried to write to the company to ask if this was typical but the email always bounced back.  The model on the insert also has a bra that\\'s falling off and bulging underwear.  Just adds to the mystery of this order.  The seller is fine - this review is just about the product.  Not sure it\\'s worth it to return these but I guess I should have guessed by the company name what to expect....some are sexy and some are quite basic.So I washed them and put on the white pair first. 2 hours later when I went to use the restroom and pulled them down and noticed huge holes all over them as if I had owned them for 20+ years. Not the just the seams, but the material looked too thin and tore everywhere. The other pairs were fine. As far as first impressions go, the first pair was a disaster. I just bought another 6 pack to see if it’s was just the white material or a defective pain that one time. Other than the 1st pair disaster the rest were ok.I actually wear these as shorts around the house. LOVE the comfort of them. I did buy a size bigger because 1) I knew I’d be wearing them for shorts and 2) a few other reviews mentioned the tightness of the band at the top so I took that into consideration. A size bigger worked great for me though!Literally garbage, not worth the two seconds it took to purchase it. It was only $3 sp I\\'m not livid but I was hoping for something remotely like the photo. Cup size is a joke. I\\'m barely a b and these couldn\\'t cover my areola. The bra straps were so long and stretchy that tightening then all the way didn\\'t do anything. The straps on the bottoms are supposed to wrap around your body and you can\\'t fit them around yourself once. I\\'m not \"skinny\" but I sure as shit ain\\'t fat and this was painful to wear.Just... No. Lol. I was ready looking forward to this piece. It\\'s a size medium first off... Looks like an XXL. The straps are sown on crooked. I\\'m just very unhappy and sad.It was too large for the bottom and too small for the top. I tossed itI had high hopes for this from the photo but I literally received some strings and elastic. Very cheap, confusing, and disappointing. I (kind of) got it on and it barely covered the top. The bottoms were a lost cause of strings and loops. Don’t waste your money. Not worth the hassle to return but shouldLiterally went to try it on and was laughing the whole time. I looked like a tied up rump roast. It was so small and not worth the $3 at all. I was hoping it would be a pleasant surprise. It wasn\\'t, sadly.Product is sooo tiny, i thought it was a joke!! It looks like it was meant for a doll. The shoulder straps are super long, the cup is very tiny I wear a full B/C cup and the left cup is torn. But I guess that’s what I get for $2.99.Esta bien.. complicado de colocar la parte de abajo pero esta bieThis thing SUCKS . Fits like its for a child 🙁😕Glad I found these!!!!  Silly Victoria Secret quit making string bikinis I have been on the hunt for replacements - these fit the bill and are BETTER!!!!  so soft and so glad I found them.  I even just bought more.  I typically wear a L at VS and bought the 7.  They fit perfectly (though oddly the tag inside says XL, but whatever, they fit, they are soft and I LOVE THEM.I bought these to be throw away panties as I just didn\\'t really have any since I - wait for it - threw them away.  I was not expecting much for the price.  I am blown away.  I wear a lot of very expensive athletic underwear that is insanely comfy so I thought my bottom would be too sensitive.  There\\'s nothing more annoying then being aware that you\\'re wearing underwear.  These are on par with $20 ones.  I\\'ve always liked this style but sometimes the sides bite in, on these the whole thing is very stretchy.  It doesn\\'t give me any muffin.  I am usually a 5 in underwear and that\\'s what I ordered.  The fit is perfect.  I am petite all around so not too much junk in the trunk or hips. It\\'s a very attractive cut and the other half finds them very cute.  I think this is an awesome deal for the price.I\\'m kind of an underwear hoarder. If it\\'s not broken and it\\'s still functional, I keep it around. Tiny string bikinis like these used to be sold in stores are sort of the ideal balance of minimal fabric and maximal coverage. I\\'ve kept mine around for close to 15 years (! oops). I love that these are sold in a full pack of black, the only functional color to me (Light colors stress me out! Ladies-- you know why!). I am considering stocking up on more and just throwing out all of my other underwear completely. I have a larger behind and hips, so the string doesn\\'t dig in like most waistbands and the seat doesn\\'t dig in either. I\\'m usually a size S in stores and ordered both the size 5 & 6; kept the size 6.I would say they fit true to size I\\'m about 148 and 5\\'6 and the size 7 fit perfectly. I love how comfortable they are. They\\'re low rise which is nice. I have a hard time finding these in stores so I was pretty excited when I found them on amazon. They barely feel like you\\'re wearing any underwear at all. The string does look really thin so I\\'m hoping it holds up. Would recommend these and buy more.I purchased these in the small (6), they were too large, but the quality and fabric were nice. So I reordered and got the xsmall (5). I\\'m petite, but have 37 inch hips and was surprised that the small was too large. Overall, these run a little big, but the smallest size fit perfect! I\\'m normally a medium or small in panties. Highly recommend. These are so soft and do not pinch on the sides or scrunch up in the back area.Can You say Comfy? I can\\'t say I have a model figure with these but ok I am 50 and God made me 😁.... feel perfect for jeans... Will hand wash bc do not need shrinkage at all ... hopefully the string will stay in one place and not move around... maybe wait to review but I just got them and they are so pretty that I yelled at some stranger lady to come see them in hotel...I know she thought I was crazy or maybe I was hitting on her bc she brought up her husband lol I never thought about what that could have looked like I\\'m an idiot...oh yeah the panties are classically simple and prettyThese underwear are so soft! They look sexy while also being very comfortable, hard to find these days!These fit a little smaller than I would have hoped, but they’re alright. I usually am a small or medium so I bought the medium, but I would probably get a large if I buy these again. Otherwise, I’m very happy with my purchase! They’re great quality and they’re pretty comfy.It\\'s almost like the heavens have shone down upon my chafing thighs. It feels like Jesus himself wrapped my chub rub in a gentle thin fabric of comfortable delight.But really. I\\'ve never been able to wear skirts or dresses in the summer, because I just can\\'t stand the pain and irritation of my legs rubbing together. I\\'ve tried using things like baby powder and body glide, but ultimately this is the only thing that has worked for me. The elastic doesn\\'t dig into my apple shaped body- which is a huge deal to this mama of 5. I will def buy this again.I bought these for my wife and daughter for when they were a dress. They both said they did exactly what they were hoping for no more rubbing thighs in dresses. These arrived fast / on time. I love it when company\\'s get their products to me when they say they will. To me that speaks volumes for the company. I have in the past dealt with some pretty crappy customer service but that is definitely not the case with this company. They have both worn them all day and said they were very comfortable soft and breathable. They both did report that they do slightly slide up from sitting to standing but they did both also say it does not do it so much that it\\'s annoying. These cotton briefs / shorts are not as long as pictured but they are close to the length pictured. Bottom line these are comfortable and exactly what my wife and daughter was looking to get. We will buy these again in the near future when they need more or a different colored pairs.Update : After having these for a couple months now they still fit them great and are still comfortable and overall holding up great and they wear these at least two to three days a week.Honest customer reviews are very important to me because I always rely on them before I purchase almost anything online. PLEASE if my review helped you at all click on the yes button below :) Thank you:Super happy with the length and comfort of these. They will be perfect underneath summer dresses. I am 5\\'6\" 120lbs and the small fits perfect. The come to about 4-5\" above my knee. But could be made shorter if need-be. I took a picture in the white pair with charcoal colored underwear to show how see-thru they are.Like many others,  I just wanted to have something to wear under my skirt in hot weather,  to avoid thigh rub without having to wear hose or a modified slip. They fit well,  didn\\'t roll up and were long enough for the intended purpose.Note,  however,  that there is no extra wicking layer,  gusset, etc at the meeting point of the legs.  There is a set of seams dead center.I like the shorts. A lot of people have commented that they are \\'sheer\\' or see-thru. They are slightly, but not that much.  They are very thin material.I ordered XL which turned out to be too small for me. They were just too tight in the waist & leg band. They fit me like a medium. I\\'m 5-3, 215lbs - I\\'m muscular, not flabby except in belly . . . some of y\\'all know how it is with us older gals.As for being \\'sexy\\' I don\\'t think these are particularly sexy. Maybe \\'sexy\\' is the new \\'practical\\'? LolI\\'d say, compared to XL items you normally buy, that these particular shorts run small. Go for the next size or two up.Meanwhile, I just ordered XXXL.  Cause I want them to \\'fit\\' not too tight - not too loose but just right. Think \\'Goldy-locks\\'.I\\'ll letcha know how they are.Thumbs up Gals for this:I wish SOMEONE would just make us some long-leg jock-shorts EXACTLY like the men\\'s without the hole in the front!First of all, they do seem to be more shorts than underwear.  The label on the package says Yoga - Workout Shorts with an MSRP of $45 for the three-pack. There’s nothing sexy about them —unless you think red is sexy. (But it probably says “sexy” on the other colors.) I’ll just put it down to an over-exuberant copy writer. They’re certainly not likely to increase the sex appeal of chubby women!I’m looking for non-chafing undies to wear under my fantastic Macabi travel skirts. These are fine for the long skirts but probably a bit too long (I’m under 5’ and they come to about 2” above my knees) for the knee-length skirt. And that’s why I chose red. Thinking they’ll be cooler if they peek out.  But they won’t be cooler in temperature although 95% cotton and 5% spandex seems to be a pretty a good combination. They’re not sheer but are definitely much lighter weight, say, than cotton knit shorts or even most capri-length, knit, exercise pants. (Made in Bangladesh).I was going to order XXL based on the “happy size 16 thighs” review, but with a way too tight XL from another brand lying around, I decided to play it safe and order the XXXL.  The package came with two XXL and one XXXL!! Held up together they appear to be the same size. And there is no noticeable difference in tightness when I tried them on. What can I tell you? The quality seems OK but who knows how long they will last. Having 3 pairs will stretch out their longevity. (Ha! An unintended pun there)They do stretch so that undies would probably be visible but would work out fine as gym (or whatever) shorts if you wear a long T-shirt that covers your butt and the top of your thighs (or just use pantiliners). The shade is a nice, bright orangie red as opposed to cherry red (more warm than cool red).  I certainly would be willing to order the other color options tho I’ll keep looking for a slightly shorter length (too hard to cut and sew stretchy knit fabric). Price was good.Update: I grabbed a pair and lo and behold: they DID feel a bit loose and they WERE the 3XL. Sooo. If you’re closer to size 18 than 16 get the 3XL. I think a size 20 gal would be OK with them as well.Maybe it\\'s a result of my own mistake but one side shrunk more than the other side in the wash.PERFECT for under summer dresses. These are not shorts you can wear except maybe around the house. They are light and a little see through but they work great for under sundresses. Super happy with this purchase. Will order more.I absolutely love these panties! Not only are they super cute, but the whitest white I\\'ve ever seen! and the material is very sleekGot here early! I ordered them maybed IF two weeks ago. Got them in today. They were supoosed to be here between like Augest 20th and Augest 21st. I\\'m SUPER. Happy with them. I did as reviews had suggested and ordered up a size so a Med. As I normally need a small. I tried them on before I washed and they fit. I washed and dryed and now I have a more perfect fit. So depending on your body type you may need to order up a size. I really didn\\'t need to. However it\\'s not a issues. The shrunk a little so I\\'m still happy. Daddy loves them too 😉 hahaThis gets less stars because one it’s too small for the sizing and doesn’t have a good description of the true sizes of each size. I wear a size 12 US sizes and got an extra large. I have to stretch it to the max to wear it. It wasn’t uncomfortable though because the material is really soft and stretchy. However the seam on the elastic broke after like two or three uses.Not the best material that I want on my lady bits, very thin and not breathable. Very small too. I feel like I am giving myself a wedgie or going to rip them at the seams when I wear them.Daddy likes them thoughThey\\'re cute but they run small despite the measurements. They say XL fits up to 46 in. hips but I\\'m 44 in. and they don\\'t fit me. Also much more cheeky than I expected, rides up causing wedgies. :PI love these ! They was supposed to come dec 22-January 17 but they came early . I ususally wear a large size in underwear but I bought a xl just in case  and they fit like a large , so if you get these might want to get one size up just in case . The material is nice and soft and shows some butt while wearing .The seems are ripped the elastic is sticking out complete waste of moneyMaybe it says on the description and I overlooked it but it\\'s polyester which is horrible, I would of likes to wear this like normal underwear. Also I do it was just weird, it\\'s not the same cut as in the image. The image underwear don\\'t have a stupid elastic waist band (which made this cut into my hips). I\\'m glad I ordered a size larger bc they were still tight, big butt woes i suppose. Idk i wouldnt recommend themOmg this outfit is beyond sexy.  The lace is for.  I love how panties have a touch of style and some freshness. I started building my sexy closet and I cant get enough.  My man loves constant surprises.  It helps to spark things up.I am 5\\'5\" tall and 130lb. I usually wear size xs to small US shirts and size 9 jeans. The size small fit perfectly and was able to adjust anywhere I needed to for a better fit. This set rivals the more expensive competition and is so delicate and beautiful. Truly a gorgeous set and helps boost your self esteem. If having a lingerie shower for a bride this is the perfect gift.This is a cute set. I love the  look and design of it. The only issue is the top is aimed more at smaller bust women and is a bit small. Of course hubby doesn\\'t mind one bit.This was so beautifully made and it feels like butter on my skin.The  garter belt is easily removed and I love that. Also for it not to have any padding in the bra it makes my breast very plump looking nice and sexy. So recommend this yassss honey😘🤑...Wonderful quality. Have bought several items from this company and have loved everything. The lace is so soft and this is a very sexy set.Great!this is the second one i bought and may buy more to have all colors. Im more a 3x size but bought a 2x and it fits perfect.Pretty and sexy at the same time. Wonderful price point for the quality of the product. I will continue to buy many items from this brand. My boyfriend loves me in anything I get from them.I hate buying underwear only to get them home and washed and realize they either ride up my crack, or cut I to my c-section scars, or fall down. These fit well, and are soft enough that even of they land on my c-section scars, they\\'re not bothered by it. I rarely have to \"pull then out\" of my crack, and they dont fall off. And have been wash a couple times, and still fit well, and look good. I\\'m 5\\'9\" and around 190lbs. I bought a second pack after a few days since I liked them so much, and threw out almost all my other underwear!I like the feel of the fabric, even the lace is soft. However, I didn\\'t realize they are suppose to be HAND WASHED!!!! WHAT? WHO hand washes panties these days?Feels like, good quality. For a pants size 4, size small fits, great! All of these came in, perfect condition, with the black, having just a little loose string, which there\\'s a picture of.I bought these for my wife and she is very happy with them.  They provide good coverage but are also very appealing, especially the lace portions in the seat.  They seem to hold up well to regular washing in cold water and hang dry.  The colors are all very nice.  Would purchase again.These panties are quality...solid detail in the lace and material.  The material leans more toward cotton so if you are looking for some other material, these won’t be right for you.I ordered a large, I am 154 lbs and wear a size 6 in jeans. They feel like a fake silk, almost like a bathing suit. Very cute panties.Nice quality. Not as cheeky as I wanted, but arrived as pictured. I\\'m 135lbs 5\\'4\" and a medium fit perfect.Beautiful. Silky. Fits like a dream. I wear a size 4 and the size small fit perfectly. They do not ride up. Says to hand wash, but I put them in a bag and wash and them in cold water with my delicates. No problems. Good buy. I’m going to order another pack of them.Very pretty, as expected. My only comment is that they are shown on what must proportionally be a very petite woman.  They are quite small but the ties make them adjustable and it\\'s not as if I was buying them for coverage. Haha. However, they might look disproportionate on a larger sized woman. I\\'m a size 6.I only bought this panty to wear underneath my vintage style lingerie (you can\\'t remove normal undies from underneath a garter belt attached to stockings). It\\'s cute and everything, but I should have expected it to fit weird - I ALWAYS have the issue with the crotch length being way too long and as a result, the panties go up waaaaay too high on me. If you\\'re super tiny like me, and have trouble fitting into VS panties (I have the same issue with them as I had with this pair), but something else. If you\\'re not, this is a super cute and easy to get off option.Got this for myself since I just like sexy stuff.  I always loved ribbon tied underwear and I found this.  I will say I am not skinny.  Size is kinda adjustable since ribbon tie.  If you are looking for those type you should try.Great quality for the price I’ve worn them all a lot and there are still holding outVery cute & good fit - untie easilySuper sexy and easily adjustable to most sizes.They are accurately advertised and decent for the price. I was not disappointed. I would hand wash not machine wash they look decent but are still cheap under wear.For bridal shower. Friend loved them!I am SO happy I ordered this. I had previously purchased a strapless corset, which was fine but didn\\'t really offer the support I wanted.  When this corset arrived, I felt comfortable in it right away.  It holds in what you want to be held in, and pushes up what you want pushed up.  I wasn\\'t worried about falling out of it and was able to spend the whole night dancing and walking around in comfort (as much as you can in a cinched corset, of course).  The fabric itself is very pretty, and not overly stiff.I\\'m 5\\'5\" and weigh 130 pounds (slim but curvy; I wear a 34DDD bra). The XL fits well. One great feature I didn\\'t understand before I received the corset is that it has a hidden zipper. You can adjust the laces to where they fit you and keep them tied. This is really helpful because I don\\'t have anyone to help me tighten the laces when I\\'m getting dressed. Another nice feature is that it has a modesty panel behind the laces in a white satin fabric. This will cover any bra, should you wear one, or your back. I plan on wearing this with either a short skirt or jeans when I go dancing. I think it looks flattering and sexy but not overly bare. I\\'m excited to wear it for the first time!I really wish this hadn\\'t been so small. I wanted to love this before it even got here. It would have been perfect for my costume but i\\'m a little worried they may have made this for a child. I am 5\\'4\" and only 115 pounds and i couldn\\'t have ever succeeded in squeezing into it. It was definitely beautiful, and looked very well made but oh, my was it small.Fits great around the body and it seems well made but the straps are so long that the corset is made only for really tall skinny people with a very long torso.Only reason it didn’t get 5 stars is because the shoulder straps are not adjustable (I have small shoulders) but I suppose if they would it would cheapen the way it looks. I bought a size S and it fit precisely as desired and expected. Everyone who saw me in it was stunned and said it looked amazing. When I told them were I got it and the price they were even more stunned. I wore it practically all work day and out trick or treating on Halloween and was pretty comfortable (I have a chronic pain condition so if something is comfy on me it’s pretty comfy). Love that it’s zipper not clasps or buttons, makes it so much easier to get on and off.I bought this for a \"saloon girl\" costume and it fits just right. I\\'m pretty busty so I was worried that even the 6xxxl wouldn\\'t fit but it does! I also LOVE the zipper on it! You can adjust the ties after you\\'ve put it on and zipped it up. Very happy with this piece! ALSO,  the shipping was VERY PROMPT!!This is really well made for the price! I was surprised at how pretty and durable it is. The detail is really nice and it doesn\\'t feel cheap at all, and the boning feels durable but flexible. The only thing that isn\\'t awesome is the lace for the back, but you can easily replace it with something sturdier. The size was as advertised (I\\'m seeing a lot of reviews saying it is too small, but I checked the measurements before I purchased, and it fits me perfectly.After reading over every review of this product, I bought the 6xl for my XL body, and the fit is pretty good! If I lost a little bit of weight I will need to get the 5xl because even with my large measurements, the laces are still pulled as short as they\\'ll go and I\\'m not uncomfortable at all! I love the zipper front, it\\'s so easy to use because I don\\'t have to wrestle with hooks. One thing to note is it pushed my breasts way up, so I\\'ll probably wear something underneath it so the entire world doesn\\'t see 70% of my boobs. Although, I\\'m sure they wouldn\\'t mind. ;)I was a little nervous ordering something that had not been reviewed yet so I want to tell other shoppers to go ahead and order these sports bras!I wear a 36DD in regular bras, ordered this in large. Fit is what I had hoped to get. Very supportive and comfortable without binding.  I walk on a treadmill or use an elliptical and these are perfect for the way I exercise. I don\\'t think they would be supportive enough for a runner though.I really like the feel of the material, it makes it really comfortable. I have always had trouble with my sports bras not fitting right in some way or another. I am very pleased with the overall fit of this bra, I especially am pleased with the padding because it\\'s just enough to prevent showing any nipple (which bugs me so much about other sports bras). I will enjoy wearing these during workouts and love the selection of cute colors. My only issue might be the pads as they seemed to get messed up pretty easily when I put the bra on but it\\'s usually fixable. I do recommend these for anyone!They’re pretty but small. Will have to exchange for a large since medium seems too small. I’m 36 B and according to the chart I should use Medium. The fabric is kinda thin.Love these bras. Fit as expected. I’m 5’4”, 160lbs.  I wanted a bra that offered easy support for running and jumping without too much compression or a super thick fabric. This fabric stretches, breathes, and washes well. Great cut and straps are comfortable. Will be buying again.I’m a 40D so I ordered the X large. It was sooo small that I couldn’t even try it on.  Photo shows this sports bra in gray size XL on top of another company’s flower sports bra XL.The product quality is exactly what you would/should expect for the price. The straps are just cheap elastic strips. Sorry I wasted my time and energy ordering this cheap product.I love everything about it. The feel on your skin is amazing, its feels Like you\\'re wearing absolutely nothing. Best Sport bra I own so far.Update —-  I changed my review to one star because after only 1-2 wears and washes, each bra is already ripping apart at different seams. Quality is poor.excellent sports bras for the price. I would say they provide a medium level of stability. I don’t plan to run in these but rather wear them on the elliptical or to yoga or just around home. And they are perfect for that.Great love them fit great look great brad is awesome I wear large on top got an xl tho cause my boobs r big and I know things tend to Strunk lil these hold up very well in washer and dryer had no problem padding can be removed or kept all round great product please measure ur self tho to many women walk around wearing wrong size bras and dont know they r so measure urself then buy size based off those numbersI wish I had found this a couple month ago this is great two piece set she love how comfy they fit IMA get her two moreVery comfortable, I\\'m curvy and have a hard time finding ones that don\\'t give constant wedgie, these are perfectI love the way these fit. Im a curvy woman (got a booty) and love that these do not end up turning into a thong!!! Lol...they are very comfortable and fit great. Im 5\\'8, 170lbs and i bought an XL.Comfy, decent coverage without looking like granny panties. Don\\'t ride up, don\\'t show through my tight jeans, don\\'t give me double butt. These are great. I am 130lbs, size 4-6 jeans and ordered a size 5 in these panties. Definitely recommend.I bought these panties and absolutely love them. comfortable and soft,  Can\\'t wait to buy more,  I would definitely recommend them for everyone.I bought XL. I wear size 12 to 14 jeans and weigh about 200 lbs. These are SO soft and comfortable. Feels like I don\\'t even have underwear on! Love! Fit as expected too!I needed new underwear for a trip and loathe going to the stores to try on clothing. One of the first items that came up in my search was this six pack, so I decided to give it a go. Holy heck, these are incredibly comfortable and I was able to wear them both casually and for active moments during my trip. They also wash easily, whether you need to handwash in a pinch or throw them in a machine. 10/10 will order again.These are true to size and comfortable.High quality, great thickness. Came out fine in the wash and very comfortable! Love these!I was wary- this was my first time ordering panties on Amazon. BUT the 20pc panties for $26 was a steal and so I decided to give it a try. Boy, I’m happy I did- the panties came in a nice variety and all of them are comfy/ stretchy. I ordered a L assuming that I’ll size up from my usual M but the L set is definitely comfy. They fit great, don’t smell and $1.30 per panty is not bad at all 😉.Most of these arent any sort of eye candy...and they are HUGE...thanks anyway 😒😝They go by measurement, not necessarily by size, which confused me initially— there were both M & L in the Medium set, but they all fit essentially the same, although some had more stretch than others.  There are a combination of stretchy laser cut (my preferred style) and lacy/ribbony/fancy pants ones that don’t stretch as well, and straight up string thongs. I generally wear a size 8/10 pants and some of the non-stretchy mediums didn’t work for me. I was super impressed with the seller, though— they kindly replaced the ones that didn’t fit with a larger size. Overall, it’s a bargain not to have to head to the store for new panties. I will totally order from them again!This is such an amazing deal on underwear. I love each and every pair I got. They all fit great. I wear an 18 in pants and buy a size 8 in underwear...I order the XXL and they fit perfect!! If you are looking for good quality undies at a good price to fill up your drawers this is the way to go or if you want to just add some sexy panties in different styles this is a good way to try out different styles. I will order this again an Ive already told my friends about Tiso they can get them some too!!!Ordered large, got half medium half large.Also one of the things came with the tag clearly cut off. Lol. Makes me think it\\'s been used... Ew.The underwear is cute. Just wish it was the same size and not tampered with.These just came and I wanted to get down the details before they became scattered and they\\'re not labelled in a way I could reassemble the exact ten I got. These are so inexpensive I thought I\\'d give them a shot, but you always wonder what kind of selection you\\'ll get. Well, here\\'s what I had:1 orange and white horizontal striped thong with string sides (no label)1 purple thong with wide pinkish lace band and bow (bonprix collection, 60% cotton, 36% polyamide, 4% elastane)1 blue thong with wide lace band (preambule, 90% polyamide, 10% elastane)1 black thong with thin vertical stripes, lace features and pink bow (secret love, nylon/elastane/polyester)1 cheeky white complete lace with wide band (body key, 85% polyester, 15% elastane)1 white complete lace thong with wide band (no company, 90% nylon, 10% elastane)1 black lay-flat thong (not sure the right term - kind of a step up from laser-cut) (secret treasures, 89% nylon, 11% spandex)1 beige lay-flat thong (same as the above)1 heather gray thong with white and pink wide logo band (bjorn borg, 51% modal, 41% cotton, 8% elastane)1 black thong with white and black medium width logo band (bjorn borg, 91% polyamide, 9% elastane)There\\'s only one I probably won\\'t be wearing at all because it\\'s on the small side, which I think 9 out of 10 is a pretty outcome for a blind buy. Glad to see only two bows - I\\'ll probably cut them off as I generally don\\'t like them. Otherwise, some will be more in rotation than others, but that\\'s more personal preference / mood I think. Overall just increasing my options which is what I had in mind. I could see ordering these again when the time comes.Read all the reviews and was not expecting too much. Perhaps I\\'d get 3-4 pairs that were decent. All except one pair were great! And the pair that wasn\\'t the best was basically frontless and crotchless haha. Ok for a Friday night perhaps, but not regular wear. I recognized a few brands from Target. One pair were Fredericks of Hollywood. One pair had a tag missing, but I recognized them as Victoria\\'s Secret. I have no idea where these come from, but I\\'d buy them again.I was really concerned about what I’d get with these! All the positive reviews made me take the chance. I’m glad I did! They send a variety which usually means left over ugly stuff that people don’t want BUT these are cute!! They also fit right! I’ll admit one pair was just okay... just nude color but o actually needed a pair of nudes anyway ;) very happy! I saved so much $ on my amazon underwear 😆.I like that it fits to size and is very comfortable.Worth the money and items has a lot of underwear in the pack. You cant go wrong with this. They stretch and had good sturdy fabric and well made. They look like they will last a while.Online showed size 7 which is a large but I received a medium so I returned as soon as I saw size.I ordered these in a size 10, they fit like a 7 or smaller. They also don\\'t stretch much. I\\'m a size 18 in pants. Disappointed because they are a lot  of undies for the price.. the size 10 would fit if you wear a 12 pants.Buena calidad. Suaves y talla ideal. Se las regalé a mi novia con cadera 113 cm. Y le quedaron un poco justas nada grave. Son talla L.Better than VS! Very cute and comfy and you get so many for the priceGood quality and fit just right, thanks!I ordered a large and received a medium.Just got my set and they are not the same as the picture which was disappointing.I decided to order these because I have such a difficult time finding underwear that I like in store. I’m very picky. I didn’t have many expectations for them since I figured I may have to return them anyway due to sizing issues, but no! They fit perfect and they’re very comfortable. The only thing I would suggest is expanding the color/designs.- I ordered a 12 pack of them and got two 6 packs of the same color/designs. Not a big deal, but might be to some.Very disappointed! The panties that I received are NOT cut like this. They are normal full fitting panties. The material is very thick nice and soft and of good quality though. Don\\'t like frauds and I am very disappointed but overall I still have good panties to wear.The cut is not even on both sides. Resulting in one side always causing discomfort..I should have just ordered a size up. Extremely disappointing. As soon as I washed them they shrunk about 2 sizes. Now they are tiny torture devices. I am so mad at myself for not ordering a size up.I love these underwear! They are so comfortable and my fiancé thinks they’re sexy! I have a really healthy butt (I wear a size 12 pant) and the large fits but if I order again I’ll buy the x-large...These parties actually fit better than expected. I’m petite around 4’10 and 85-90 lbs and these fit like a dream. They’re extremely comfortomble and look pretty seamless under clothes. I ordered two packs of these and was sent a pretty good variety of colors and patterns, the patterns being stripes, which I love. All in all a good purchase and would definitely repurchase in the future.I knew it was a bit of a gamble as to the colors I would get but I was hoping for more than just grey, white and granny flowers... will be returning.Ordered according to sizing and had to exchange cause they were too small. After one to two washes nearly every pair has a hole or multiple holes. They\\'re pretty but cheap quality, especially for the price.They are so prettyThese aren\\'t supposed to be called boyshort. Those I\\'ve received look more like hipster.The lace is not form fitting it\\'s to loose, I don\\'t recommendlooked nice on add but is the price worth- and nothing more..........So sexy! I love this hipster/boyshort panties. These fit amazing. I haven\\'t had a problem with them falling apart in the wash like some people have stated. I got a small im 5\\'3 110 lbs and they fit perfect. I do have a butt and they hug it nicely. 😊SiFalls apart easily in the washSon de mal materialGreat!Okay so first these are good for the money. They would be great if they were all the same size. I bought them for my wife and ordered Large as the reviews stated 58% claim they run small. I sent them back as they were spot on large- well she is not. I ordered the medium and they were perfect however only 4 of them were perfect 2 were too small. So 4 out of 6.  They all said medium but the 2 were much smaller than the other 4.I should have listened to the reviews. They were exactly what I wanted in every aspect. However, true to the reviews, NONE of them fit the same. I literally received two pairs that fit at all...and only one of those two fit the way I prefer. The shorts are VERY comfortable....the manufacturer just needs to get their production assembly together.So soft and silky great for laying around the houseI love these! I got nervous because of the reviews but they are so cute and comfy! The only thing I have to say is I didn’t get the silver cheetah print one or whatever it was..instead I got a dark red striped one in place of it and honestly I didn’t want the cheetah one and bought them for the striped ones so it all worked out. Good deal for pajama bottoms. Thanks so much!Sizing for shorts are very inconsistent with one pair being too small.Very comfortable not to mention adorable. The pictures do not do these boxers justice!  Love ‘em, will be buying more, and highly recommend!I am exchanging for a larger size because these fit very smallLove the thin cotton and wear them are very comfortable!Hope we can choose the pattern of the products.I always have a hard time purchasing panties in general never mind adding the online aspect which always make things even more difficult. I wanted to make sure that these would fit comfortably and not ride up and give me wedgies all day. I decided to order a medium. I am 5\\'3\" 130lbs I usually wear a size 4 / 6 in pants and a small or medium. I am actually very surprised at how comfy these are. I usually get my panties from vs and I actually feel these are made better. The vs ones are all lace in the back and the lace rips. These are lace also however there is a sheer liner which stops and holes from being made. Happy with my purchase!I think these are beautiful to look at. The colors are rich and don\\'t fade in the wash. But they are a little pinchy at the waist and leg holes - the elastic doesn\\'t give as much as I\\'d like for it to be comfortable. The lace can itch, especially where there\\'s also elastic, but really a solid lace panty isn\\'t really a choice made for comfort! Definitely a date night staple in my house.I was a little worried to order online without seeing the fabric in person but I was NOT disappointed. Not only these are very pretty but they are also comfortable. I wear them with jeans and these do not show at all. Great alternative to wear instead of thongs. I like the fact that it has all the different colors you might need for lighter and darker pants. I will be getting a second set of these.No show underwear is one of the most important features to me when I shop for undergarments. Luckily, I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. I do like that the pack of 6 comes with different colors, which is helpful for different color outfits. They’re surprisingly comfortable (considering the lace) and look good at the same time. Not itchy and true to size.I absolutely love these panties. Inwas looking to upgrade my panties because well basically im.a mom and the last in the house for new underwear. These panties are so comfie. The material is super soft and not scratchy at all the waste has good stretch to it. They seem to hold up in the wash well I like them. The patern is super cute.I searched for days to find some really pretty lacy underwear to go with the new bras I was going to purchase (also from Amazon). So glad I found these! They came in and the colors almost matched up to the bras perfectly. The underwear is comfortable with a mesh lining so you\\'re not scratched by the lace. Super sexy with the bras!I love these underwear. They fit me so well and they don’t leave any lines! There is a cotton liner which is really appreciated. They don’t dig into my hips either. I ordered a large and typically wear a large and they fit perfectly.These underwear are super comfy! The material is sturdy and silky smooth and also holds up in the washer! The designs imprinted are very elegant. The fit is as expected and feels like I don’t have anything on at all!! Will be buying more!!These were really pretty and not a bad price considering you get 8 of them. I\\'m sure I would have loved these..IF THE ONES I ORDERED WERE ACTUALLY THE ONES I GOT!!! I\\'d never order from them again until they can actually photograph what you actually will get!! The print WAYYYY down at the bottom states \"you may not get exact colors\" etc.Well there are 8 pair and I got 3 doubles out of 8 total!! They show all these various pretty colored ones and what you get is 2 pair of one style..2 pair of another style..and 2 pair of another style..then one other..then one other. So what happens, which was EXACTLY what I hoped would NOT happen..I got doubles of the ones I don\\'t like so much and I NEVER GOT THE TWO THAT I INITIALLY ORDERED THESE FOR!!! There is nothing WORSE then to SEE what you want, PAY for it, then get NONE of the style you wanted!! So yes..read all the way at the bottom of their description and KNOW..you will NOT get what is pictured!! When THIS company can correct that..people should NOT order these at ALL!! It\\'s like wanting an apple and ordering it..then they bring you a lemon!! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!\\xa0That\\'s a very  cute looking panties for the price . And hey, I did not expect them to be  a high quality - I know how much I paid for them, so let\\'s be realistic here . U would not want to wear them all day long bc of uncovered elastic inside( see video),  but they would be awesome for showing off and looking pretty. One of received has a loose threads on it, but come on, I am not gonna wear them for 5 years strait , so I am ok with that. Before posting this review , I washed them twice ( in a mesh bag, regular setting) - nothing happened , and air dried - I think hot air would damage the fabric. The colors are super cheerful and omg, how bored I am of all grey/black /beige plain cotton  overwhelming the market, so those colorful panties are like a breath of fresh air ! What do u need to know : they made of thin, shiny, rustling polyester, very lightweight, become softer after washing, lightly constructed and stretch very well, have tiny cotton gusset , fit comfortably, sizing is correct ( my hips are 38, ordered size M, fit me well ),  colors are bright. Please be aware of the elastic band mentioned above - it could really irritate, so no prolong walking in this panties. Overall:  for 2.25 a pair I absolutely enjoy this flirty panties and I definitely look pretty and sexy  in them ).  4 stars instead of 5 for that uncovered elastic band.overall they are very nice, comfy, sexy, and like the picture. The only bad thing I received 2 repeated animal print, and another similar to them.. but thats my taste.. In general I dislike animal print. Besides that, Im usually size m in victoria secret and other brands, but this one run a bit smaller, still fit though. One came a bit bigger than the others (maybe an actual M size). But in general I would recommend this purchase, just check the sizes if your are not very sure about yours.Was disappointed that I didn\\'t receive all of the colors as pictured and got doubles instead. The sizing was all over the place. Definitely get what you pay for.Most of these are nice however some of the threads unraveled just after 1 wear but even though they unraveled they are still wearable. Not the best quality but not extremely unhappy with this purchase.As advertised. These thongs are cheap, sexy, and fun! They\\'re not high quality, nor did I expect them to be. My experience was similar to other customers\\' complaints about the exposed elastic. It would certainly make for a better product if the elastic bands were encased in the fabric. I wouldn\\'t suggest wearing a pair all day... these are just fun for a romp in the hay. ;)I used to be able to find my favorite thong panties in this light, satiny material at a popular \"very sexy\" lingerie store, but they stopped making them.  These come the closest--comfy and fit just right.  Great price too.After the first wear, thread started coming off. So far had to toss out 3 in a week! Poorly made and extremely unsatisfied!Not what I expected. Said boyshort on order,and package, but its more like a hipster or brief, than boyshort. When I tried them on, they come up higher on rear end, and thigh than depicted. Not what I wanted, but I\\'m going to try them out anyway. The quality seems good. I like the cloth covered elastic, and no tags.They ride up when walkingProduct quality is truly cotton. But the fit is poor. I followed the size chart and still did not get a good fit. These are not boy shorts. The are BIKINI cut. I read that in other reviews too before I bought it and was taking a chance.As you can see from the picture the \\'6 pack\\' I received was actually 2 of the same 4 packs with one removed. The XL size fits fine, I\\'m 5\\'5\" 220 lbs. They are fine for the price but I was expecting some fun patterns. I also hate white underwear and now have two pairs. Won\\'t bother to return.I love the feel of the fabric of these panties but there are two big problems. They are too lowrise in the back and they are wedge inducing!!! There is a bit of a need for design improvement.Item as described sizes run a wee bit on smaller side however that does not affect product as I was aware of it by their size chart. (just noting for anyone who may ask). Packaged well no issues with productI love the packaging these panties come in and sometimes the little things matter. They are very soft cotton and well made too. I just bought a medium a month ago and they were a tiny bit smaller then I would like, I was 152 weight then so this time I got the large because I gained 10 pounds and they will shrink a bit in dryer. They are not a full coverage boyshort and more like a hipster style when it comes to my fit. But all in all I\\'m happy with the quality and this is my third time purchasing this brand.These boyshort panties fit really nicely.  The fabric is a nice weight and does not stretch out over time.  The description says that the patterns will vary and not necessarily match the picture. The ones I received do not match the picture but they are cute.  You can slightly see them on your cheeks through jeans so I would assume that you would be able to see them a bit through leggings too but not a lot.  Overall I really like them and they are super comfy.These are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! We all go through that phase of pregnancy where we think we can actually make our regular underwear work until the end. Then somewhere between 20-30 weeks we hit that wall of surrender and realize we need new underwear...NOW! Like yesterday.This is my 4th pregnancy, and I\\'ve never found underwear this cute or this comfortable. I started thinking about a design that might actually work well for me and found these online. Then I looked everywhere for this style in stores because I didn\\'t want to buy underwear online that might not work. I couldn\\'t find this style in stores, so I broke down and ordered it online. I\\'m so glad I took the risk and bought the 5 pack!!!It has a flattering shape under my belly, and doesn\\'t add ANY pressure to my already tight abdomen. I feel sexier in my panties than I\\'ve ever felt at this stage of pregnancy.I am 5\\' 7\". I’m around 130lbs when I\\'m not pregnant. I generally wear a medium pre-pregnancy and it gives me a little extra room. I\\'m active, in good shape, and on track to gain ~30lbs with this pregnancy  (which is a healthy amount for me). I listened to reviews and bought the large instead of the medium. I thought they might be too big after they came in, but once I laundered them they fit quite well with a tiny bit of stretch room to carry me through the end of pregnancy.I cannot explain how happy I am with these underwear. I use these 5 underwear in combination with 3 Hanky Panky low-rise thongs (worth every penny!!!), and I\\'ve never been more happy with my maternity undergarments. Just wish I\\'d had them for my last 3 pregnancies.SIDE NOTE: WHY HAS IT TAKEN THE MATERNITY INDUSTRY SO LONG TO FIGURE OUT THIS DESIGN?!!! And where are the jeans like this?! Granted you\\'d need a long shirt, but seriously, pregnant women have been folding their pants down for decades. When women like a style enough to deal with extra bulk... Someone please catch on!!!Also, I can\\'t get my poor husband\\'s name off of this review. :/I am 5\\'5\", 150lbs, and 14w pregnant and I ordered a large based on the reviews. I normally order a small or medium in undies. I was worried that they would be too large when I opened the package, but I think they just looked large because they are full-bottomed. They ended up fitting really well. Full bottom, but low in the front to allow for the belly. Im happy to have undies that don\\'t roll down over on themselves because of my growing belly!The fabric is a nice medium weight with good elasticity and very comfortable. I will likely be buying more.Hi there, I’m a real person who tried these undies on over a pair of ponte knit maternity pants (there are rear pockets on the pants so that’s why the rear picture has some bumping in the back).  I am 5’10” 189 lbs pregnant at 23 weeks and I am currently wearing large/12 in maternity pants. I bought these under bump undies in size XL. As you can see in the picture, they are VERY low in the front. Which is what I wanted. They have very full coverage in the back. They are smooth and well stitched. I am super happy with this purchase! I hope they wash well cause I always wash undies in hot water for sanitary reasons and I always put laundry in the drier at low heat. Let’s be honest, as a pregnant, full time worker with a five year old, I very rarely line dry undies.  So crossing my fingers! Great price too, $20 for 5 good quality pantiesWhen reading the reviews of this product, I was skeptical. Some said order a size larger than normal, others said use the size chart, but everyone seemed to love them. I did not have a problem with my underwear being too tight with my first pregnancy, so this was an unusual thing to look for. The size chart said I needed a size larger than normal which for me was a medium. They fit perfectly and are not tight on my stomach or legs at all. I am 5\\'4\" and 120 pounds and usually wear a small if anyone is trying to size themselves.This is my second pregnancy and I have no idea why I never got these for my first! They are beyond comfortable and put no pressure on your belly like normal underwear. I’d been wearing the seamless style from VS thinking they were great (you can see in the photos they were NOT great and left lines and put added pressure on my bump) I didn’t notice how uncomfortable they were UNTIL I PUT THESE ON! Seriously can’t recommend these enough and will be gifting all my pregnant friends with them!I didn\\'t think I really *needed* maternity underwear but I\\'m so glad I bought them!  I did not get the lace ones (some pics of reviews showed several strands) and got the regular band ones instead.  They are perfect.  I don\\'t really have any bottom so a lot of underwear rides up.  These underwear stay put and they are so comfortable way below the band.  Most of my underwear is stretchy but there were some pairs that ended up itching at the top panty line. I\\'m on here buying the 5 pack now!  I ended up getting a large.  I usually would wear a medium but didn\\'t want to go smaller since I\\'m 20 week. The large was perfect.  I\\'m usually a size 6 pants if that helps.I was super excited to try these, since wearing most normal undies while pregnant is uncomfortable.  Now, I am a petite gal.. and not necessarily a hot box by any means.  I am generally a bit cold in most environments. However, these panties do NOT breathe at all, making me very hot and bothered.. and not in a good way.  Plus, the crotch liner\\'s top seam is very low and cuts right at my inner bits, so they are very irritating to wear.  I can\\'t wear them for more than like 5 minutes (if) without tossing them off and wishing I would not have bought them.  I know lots of ladies that love this blend for their undies, and several brands use this blend, but I can\\'t stand it myself.  I wish it was not so hard to find pure, 100% soft cotton undies.  The under-the-belly part is the only good aspect about these.I was a little nervous ordering something that had not been reviewed yet so I want to tell other shoppers to go ahead and order these sports bras!I wear a 36DD in regular bras, ordered this in large. Fit is what I had hoped to get. Very supportive and comfortable without binding.  I walk on a treadmill or use an elliptical and these are perfect for the way I exercise. I don\\'t think they would be supportive enough for a runner though.I really like the feel of the material, it makes it really comfortable. I have always had trouble with my sports bras not fitting right in some way or another. I am very pleased with the overall fit of this bra, I especially am pleased with the padding because it\\'s just enough to prevent showing any nipple (which bugs me so much about other sports bras). I will enjoy wearing these during workouts and love the selection of cute colors. My only issue might be the pads as they seemed to get messed up pretty easily when I put the bra on but it\\'s usually fixable. I do recommend these for anyone!They’re pretty but small. Will have to exchange for a large since medium seems too small. I’m 36 B and according to the chart I should use Medium. The fabric is kinda thin.Love these bras. Fit as expected. I’m 5’4”, 160lbs.  I wanted a bra that offered easy support for running and jumping without too much compression or a super thick fabric. This fabric stretches, breathes, and washes well. Great cut and straps are comfortable. Will be buying again.I’m a 40D so I ordered the X large. It was sooo small that I couldn’t even try it on.  Photo shows this sports bra in gray size XL on top of another company’s flower sports bra XL.The product quality is exactly what you would/should expect for the price. The straps are just cheap elastic strips. Sorry I wasted my time and energy ordering this cheap product.I love everything about it. The feel on your skin is amazing, its feels Like you\\'re wearing absolutely nothing. Best Sport bra I own so far.Update —-  I changed my review to one star because after only 1-2 wears and washes, each bra is already ripping apart at different seams. Quality is poor.excellent sports bras for the price. I would say they provide a medium level of stability. I don’t plan to run in these but rather wear them on the elliptical or to yoga or just around home. And they are perfect for that.Great love them fit great look great brad is awesome I wear large on top got an xl tho cause my boobs r big and I know things tend to Strunk lil these hold up very well in washer and dryer had no problem padding can be removed or kept all round great product please measure ur self tho to many women walk around wearing wrong size bras and dont know they r so measure urself then buy size based off those numbersI normally wear a 32b bra, have a 26 inch waist, and a 36 hip, and the small fit great! It\\'s just a little roomy where the bra clips in the back but not so big that it is loose. So sexy! It is just as pictured and I cannot wait to wear it!I am 5’4” and 130lbs, 32B-C, 2 pants size. I ordered a small. The top’s inner straps over the bust were too big, as well as the strap around the under. I used some creative tying to make it tight enough, but always disappointing when the smallest size is too big.The triangle panel on the thong was sewn weird and puffy looking instead of laying flat on the skin. Skirt fit fine.It was cute in person and flattering on my stomach. Husband liked the outfit, and I may wear it again, but fit and construction were cheap compared to other lingerie sets I’ve bought in the sameness price range.Pleasantly surprised!  Super soft and fit like a glove.  Very flattering.  I’m 5’7 and sz 8/10.SexyThis is a pretty piece, but definitely peculiarly sized.The underwear were super high and decently fitting, while the top was reasonably skimby, albeit not in line with the sizing of the bottoms, i.e. small cup coverage with extremely wide band sizing.Husband LOVED the outfit and it fit perfectly!It fits like a glove just like the picture...I liked it a lot my Papi liked it more.I love this outfit. It’s really pretty and good quality, especially for the price. The top was a little big but I have a small chest, I wear a 38B and I ordered an XL. I should have went down a size but was worried the bottoms would be small.  Overall, I am happy I purchased it.Covered enough but showed a little cheek.Fit is excellent, fabric is nice, well made.Fits great, looks sexy! Very comfy!Love the way it looks and feelsIf you are like me and think 22 bucks for a thong is too high then this pair is a great substitute for hanky panky thong. Comfy, stretchy and fit is almost the same as more expensive brand.I LOVE IT.... It is JUST What I was looking for.... So im 5\\'3 and Im 256lbs Today... Bloated and this product fit me perfectly.... I ordered a 4x because of other people reviews who were smaller then me but also ordered the 4x.......So first of all.... IT WILL BE HARD PUTTUNG ON..... You have to hold your stomach in, look in the mirrior and start from the bottom..... YOU Will probably think its too SMALL.... Its NOT YOU are suppose to be able to squeeze it all in.... and thats what I did and I LOOK AMAZING.....My Opinion 200lbs - 220 GET  (2x)Or if you are between 220 - 240  (3x)My WEIGHT GROUP...... 240 - 260  (4x)IT Doesn\\'t hurt... it doesn\\'t rise in the back... its good quality..... its priced perfectly.... as far as size go up between 2/3 SizesDepending on how tight your clothes are you will see the zipper underneath a lil.... Im on my way to the GYM!!!!Thank me later for my detailed review lolFirst, I’ll start by saying I’ll try to load a picture that is embarrassingly real. This is a great waist trainer and it mostly stays put.However, are you above a size 6? Does your tummy sag? This may not be the product for you. I’m 5’4 and it’s shirt on me. It does NOT cover my belly, and I just had a c section. It pushes my belly out, but does make my waist look nice.I would prefer something that will go lower on my torso.Fit: I opened it and I was like yeah.... this is NOT going to fit. Don’t me intimidated; put it on. Give it a go. It is true to size as hard as it may be to believe the first time. I’m a 12 -14 post baby and I got the XL.So yes, your waist will look good. You will be able to breathe in it. It’s wearable all day. I didn’t notice any problems in 3 days with my sensitive skin. No sweating (although it is winter). But note this isn’t for someone like me who needs more coverage on bottom.I am a size 16/18 with a belly.  I bought a 3X because so many people said it runs so small.  I should have bought a 2X and I will next.  I want to say:  this is a waist trainer - it is supposed to be TIGHT, I mean really, really tight, otherwise it will not train your waist.  You should have to lie down and pull on both sides as hard as you can to get it to close.  Then when you start, you can only wear it for a few hours each day and gradually you can wear it for longer.  So if you want to train your waist, ignore all of the people who say it is too small.I\\'m giving it 5 stars because it is a good product.  I like how the back is high.  I had one before that did not go up my back and the waist trainer just pushed all of my back fat up in a huge roll just under my bra, so that didn\\'t work.\\xa0I didn’t like the way it fit I have nice waist trainers but can’t use them because I just gave birth so I bought this one and it folds up in the back like bulges like a hump it’s awkward and won’t go away so I just bought a bigger size from the company I always buy waist trainers fromI’m loving this waist trainer! I am 5”3’ and I wear a medium in tops but would be catergorized as thick not slim. Also I am on average a 8-10 in dresses. Just giving a bit of background for anyone looking to purchase this item.I ordered the medium hoping that it would fit. My large waist trainer was becoming very roomy, but I had purchased it from a different seller and was not entirely sure I was ready for the medium.Anyhoo...This one is perfect!I have it on the first set of hooks and it’s very comfortable and will not let you slouch at all. I love the hook/zipper combo. It makes the waist trainer feel more secure. And the over the shoulder straps are adjustable which made the trainer more comfortable. I’m ordering another one today so I always have a clean one ready to go!As far as the sizing goes I will say this much. My family is old school and I have been wearing some kind of cincher or girdle since puberty so my definition of comfort might not be the same as another’s. I feel like this is a perfect medium for someone who is actively waist training. It holds you but still has the flexibility so you can move about normally. I think it fits true to size if you want that extra hold. Waist training is not supposed to feel like nothing. You are supposed to be aware of the garment but never be in pain.I had to choose between M and L because I was in the middle with my waist size. I\\'ve bought M to wear it longer.  It is quite small but that\\'s what I expected  :)This is strong and nice fabric and I like it but it wrinkles a lot on my waist.  Fortunately it\\'s unnoticeable even under tight shirtFirst and foremost great fit of the product. Came packaged nicely. Fit is exactly as the size chart said. Extremely comfortable. I wear this over a tanktop over 8 hours a day. The key is to not start out too tight but gradually as to not have any health issues and allow the waist to cinch effortlessly without any hassle and this product does it.Ordered the 2XXL based the the companies size chart NOT AMAZON\\'S. The chart is in their images before anyone buys measure yourself! Looking to purchase the XL now since I currently fit the XXL and would like to go tighter. Love the boost it gives my bust and the flattening it does to my back. I wear this under my work shirt and you can\\'t even tell. Very comfortable!!!OMG. My waist is 36.5 inches and I ordered this waist trainer in size Large. It fits AMAZING! When  I say my waist is snatched, I mean it is snatched. 1st I purchased size XL, it fit but it wasn\\'t snug. I was able to go to the 3rd (tightest) prong with the 1st wear, so I wasn\\'t getting optimal results. This Large size is perfect!! Great quality. I highly recommend this waist trainer.Beautiful product for the an amazing price! I buy very expensive lingerie all the time, but this piece is just as worth showing off as anything else when it comes down to it.This is a very beautiful set. I was very impressed that Amazon had such a nice set. As the reviews have said, a different bra size comes in but t fits perfectly. I guess it\\'s a thing for them, they probably have a different sizing. But that doesn\\'t bother me. The panties are a little bit tight on me but they still look fine. I do have bigger lower body than my upper body so maybe it\\'s just me. You will not regret buying this! Very pretty & super fast delivery.It\\'s so gorgeous! I also bought the red one. It\\'s such a beautiful set. It also makes my boobs look super nice, so that\\'s a plus! So pretty! Gonna order the white one next!!I\\'m 5\\'7, 120 pounds, and ordered a 34D. It fit me perfectly! I am very impressed with the quality and the fit, and so excited to wear this.I was a little worried about the fit. I followed their sizing instructions and I chose to go with a 34 A  to get the M underwear . Everything fits perfectly!!! I’m very happy I bought this. Amazing quality for the price and pretty darn close to what they show in the picture . Also comes in a cute ziplock bag . I think the lace details on the tops of the cups of the bra is slightly different but still looks amazing . Love it ! Very sexy and I can’t wait to wear this . I plan to buy the red one as well.I am very impressed with the quality. Both the bra and underwear are very soft. Feels to me like something that should be priced much higher than it was. I am a 32B, 110lbs and I\\'m 5\\'7\" and the underwear hug nicely, not too tight and certainly not too loose. The bra I was a little worried about at first because it looked a little flat, but as soon as I had it on, it fit like a glove. No gaps between the cup and my chest, and the straps and band are comfortable, secure and don\\'t dig into my skin.I highly recommend this lingerie set if you\\'re looking for something affordable, well fitting, and sexy!This set was incredibly flattering and very high quality! My husband said this was his favorite set he\\'s ever seen me in (and I\\'ve spend loads of money on lingerie that costs 6 times the price of this set). Blue whale, please keep making these gorgeous makeup matching sets!I am a lingerie snob! I have bought all kinds of different brands, from really expensive to uber cheap (just to see what kind of difference there was between the two). This set is super for the price point. It\\'s actually super in general. Don\\'t expect it to be something you\\'ll find supportive or perfect under thin clothing. But do expect it to look fabulous, sexy and classy. I had ordered a few different brands that looked similar and was seriously dissapointed. The top fits well and the underwear fit nicely... it was just a very pleasant suprise!I like the product, the lace is very nice, but the size charge is very misleading. I\\'m 5\\'7 and weigh 130 lbs. I normally wear size 4 -6 pants and medium size underwear, so I followed the size chart and bought a size L (US S 4-6). Here is a picture comparing my old size M underwear and this supposedly size US S underwear. The difference is huge!!! They are so loose, I have to return them and re-order a smaller size.For the price, the quality is great. The material is very thin and almost not noticeable when I put it on. I am very picky with thongs, and these are the only ones that I don\\'t feel like I have a wedgie all the time.Love that they are soft, don\\'t ride up in the thong area and don\\'t leave panty lines. Fit is perfect. I am 5ft 3\" and weight 115lbs.I like my thongs to rise /sit above my hip bones... Sorta like a high bikini cut. So I purchased a medium (I\\'m usually a small) . The medium is perfect,  but I\\'m sure a small would have worked too. They are very stretchy and don\\'t dig at all. I can really pull them up high.  I don\\'t expect these to last long only because it\\'s lace...all my lace undies rip from my nails snagging. The quality of this lace is really good for what your paying for. They do have a slight plastic smell so make sure to wash them first. They are basically undetectable under yoga pants (which is the reason I bought these). They came with a bracelet and a sleep mask (I tossed them they felt cheap). For reference I\\'m 5ft, 120 lbs, wear a size 3/5 in jeans. Average built. I say they\\'re \"true to size\"  depending on how you like your undies to sit is how you should choose your size.They\\'re nice, I went down a size like suggested in many other reviews. I wish I hadn\\'t. They fit, a little smaller than I\\'d like, but it\\'s because I went down a size. I would say they fit true to size if you have a bigger butt.They\\'re good enough... soft, decorated, but I dropped a star because they are approx. one size TOO BIG even though I followed the drop-down menu and chose my correct US size. Better larger than too small... but obviously, you\\'d want your undies to fit nicely. My advice is to MAYBE consider RISKING ordering one size smaller to fit (but I really don\\'t know how seller will sort sizes).Not the world softest lace but not scratchy or irritating to my sensitive skin. The colors arrived as shown and are true to the pictures. I’ve washed and dried them about 4 times so far. The elastic strings that are woven into the lace (to make them stretchy and comfy) are starting to stick out and kinda unravel. If you have bought Pink lace panties before then you know what I’m referring to probably. Its not a deal breaker for me, but they don’t look new for long. I don’t go showing my thongs off anyways, so it’s fine but for anyone that wants really high quality ones, I’d look elsewhere.Maybe I\\'ve been spoiled by the incredible quality + feel of Hanky Panky lace thongs ($20 a pair), but these were just not comfortable whatsoever. They felt itchy and poorly made. They also ran at least one size too large on me. Great price, but bad quality. If you\\'re not as sensitive to low-quality materials, maybe these would work for you. Donating these to my local women\\'s shelter.It’s a great price for the things. They’re very pretty. The company also included two free gifts I didn’t expect: a sleep mask and a necklace (included in the picture). I would re-purchase.Positively love them.  Give as gifts.NiceSuper cuteMakes my boobs look amazing.I love floral anything, so the design was perfect. The pale pink lace is adorable too. I love this bra. It’s comfortable, and fits so nicely. No gap or overspill. It makes my boobs look so great. The underwear is comfy too. It doesn’t ride up.I would suggest getting a size bigger for band size. I’m a 34B, & with this bra I’m on the very last hook.Super cute set! I usually wear small underwear and I\\'m a solid 34C in most bras. The underwear fit great, but I felt the cup and the band size to be a little small for a 34C. Because of this, it\\'s not the most comfortable bra, but I still wear it.The bra and panty set is great! The bra is soft, flexible and comfortable but also gives a nice shape. The floral color is better than the photos show. It’s like silk material, I’m not sure... Overall I like the bra. I want to buy more but here just one color...This is a super cute bra and panty set... I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly 👌I\\'m not sure what the front.of.the panty is made of but it\\'s crazy soft and smooth so not.only do I look super cute but they are comfy tooIt really gives perfect fit. Give push up with comfort. The material is soft and the bra is very light weight. Definitely recommended.Such a cute sexy bra set. Literally hugs you in the right places and is really good material. Love the fitting and sizingBra is very well made , soft and feels very natural, panties seem a little fragile but beautifulI am in love with this thing.Fits perfectly.Loved the color and the print.Soft and great clothing material.You would never know I bought these from Amazon and not VS. The material is so nice and soft and the lace part is so well made, I\\'m really really impressed! I am done shopping at expensive panty stores! 😁Received these panty, try on right away !Wow ! These panty are pretty, sexy and comfortable with good quality  ! Just love the lacy styleHonestly did not expect the underwear to be so beautiful! Excellent quality lace, stretchy enough to fit (I wore a medium), but also snug enough to illustrate your curves. For the price you pay, you get an amazing deal with these. Love them and even ordered other products. Also the colors were beautiful. Shrinks a little bit after wash but still fits great!Somewhat smaller than I anticipated, material was good held up to machine washing & colors were as pictuted. My waist is 35 hips 46 they were snug on me.Comfortable and quality. I\\'m a voluptuous size 16 and ordered the xxl, they are a perfect sexy fit!Knew I couldn’t return them worn but I tried a pair on and they fit perfectly and comfortable. Happy with purchase.These seem like they are great quality! They are soft and the seems are sewn nicely. They have a cotton liner on the inside which adds extra comfort!These were not nearly as stretchy as I would have expected. Not as flattering as I hoped.True to size and comfortable. My guy was very surprised and very happy!Got his bra and panty set for the boudoir bridal session I did as a wedding present. They fit great, the bra has good pushup worked for what I needed it for. Would not recommend to wear under clothes though ;)These fit absolutely perfect.  The bra is comfortable, flattering and the straps stay in place all day.  The panties are equally comfortable and flattering.  I normally only buy my bras from one mainstream store.  But I must say, this bra fits equally as good, makes me look equally as good and it a fraction of the price!  The bra and panties look just like they do online as well.  They came in a nice zip lock like pouch that I could find some way to reuse.super comfy & totally worth the money :-)I love this panty/bra set! It feels great on my skin, so soft and comfortable. It fits as expected, just fits perfectly. I love the color as well. Definitely buying this again in another color.I really like the color and the material/fabric seems to be good. I think is a fair price for the set (bra+pantie). I\\'ll probably buy other colors in the future. I bought 34b USA sizeI am very glad that I purchased this set. It is comfortable, soft, and the color is a lovely wine red instead of the bright red. I will definitely order more in the future.I love this set, the 4th time i order it!It fit perfectly for me. Comfortable and sexyI am a fairly thick woman, 5 ft, 175 lbs, usually a size large in leggings. I didnt want to risk them needing to stretch too much because I didn\\'t want them to become see through, so I ordered up a size as other reviewers suggested and  they fit perfectly. They are even squat proof! (I tested it in a bright bathroom, so believe me, as long as you order the right size and they aren\\'t too small and stretched to the max, they are NOT see through!The honeycomb texture of these leggings completely conceals any dimples or cellulite. The waistband is pretty high so any tummy is sucked in, which is critical for me, as I just had a baby 3 months ago. I am been blessed with a pretty good butt, but these give it an extra oomph. I just put them on for the first time and my husband came in and made a point to say how amazing my \"assets \" look!  I was standing in front the mirror in the bathroom, and I even caught him in the reflection continueing to stare lol!My only complaint is that they are pretty long. I am very short  and normally have bunching at the ankles with most leggings,  but I have more bunching than usual with these.Even so its not enough to take away how pleased I am with these leggings. I\\'ll be washing them in the delicate cycle to ensure they don\\'t get ruined, so hopefully they hold up! I\\'ll likely had to get another pair since I like them so much.Recieved these on time, were so comfortable, fit great, and I wore them the day after I got them all day. I loved these, I didn\\'t even have to worry about pantry lines showing through or the waistband giving me a muffin top. But after wearing these all day, just doing regular day to day things, and then sitting on my couch watching a show, I took these leggings off and discovered multiple holes had formed around the \"scrunch butt\" seam just from me sitting. I was hoping these could be a staple for workouts and more, but there is no way they would hold up to any exercise if the seams are that fragile. Incredibly disappointed and had to throw these away after just one use...\\xa0In love ! I’m surprised with the quality of this leggings. Squat proof 👌confortable and the color is accurate to the picture . I’m 5”0 124 pounds  . I ordered a size small . Fits perfect . I highly recommend this leggings ! I’m thankfulI really enjoy the texture of these leggings. I think they’re different and eye catching. I like that when they say high waisted they mean it. I do notice some tummy control and I believe they are true to size (I am 5’7”, 178lbs) I ordered a large. However, they are definitely not squat proof... or underwear proof (if wearing white underwear it shows through). I am also experiencing some itchiness - but think it is because of the texture or that they just need a good wash.  I will be keeping them!I love it❣️ I am 5 foot 7 weigh 210 lbs and I order a large and it fits just right! I ordered an extra large from another vendor and that fits just right as well, but of course the large has a tighter fit.  so I figured you have to go with your waist size or closest to it... to get the right fit.Just literally took them outta the bag, looked at the rouching inside, tugges on it a little.. and it tears! And the pants are black..the elastic rouch is white..u can totally see through it! 🙄☹😔I love 😍! they are super comfortableWill be buying in more colors! Fit perfectly, squat proof and overall a great find on Amazon! The waist band elastic needs to be adjusted sometimes but not a huge deal. Butt scrunch is very cute!Too small, doubt it would fit a life size Barbie doll let alone my butt or the butt in the photo. It\\'s too bad. They were cute. I don\\'t see how they fit the model because my butt is even smaller than that. I did let the company know and they did give me my money back, so I have to give it 3 stars for professional no questions asked money refunded ( it says it was, you have to double check ) back to me.I like these panties. They’re soft and are not cheap feeling. Only thing I find wrong is they are a bit big for a medium. I’m 5’8 140lbs and could fit into a small. I’ll be ordering more in a small.These hipsters are very sexy: the colors are very nice and the lace is beautiful. They are made of a very durable material as well: I washed them about a dozen of times now and the colors is still bright and the lace design is intact. They are very comfortable to wear but somewhat too small: front, back and waist are fine, but they are tight in the inner thigh area.Super cute, soft, and fit me well.  However, after only a few washes, a few pairs are starting to fray and unravel in some places.They are beautiful. !! The size is perfect as they describe it. Now, the material is not of good quality.Purchased as a gift. These have a very soft material. The recipient doesn\\'t like thongs, as a general rule, but needs these for work. They say that these thongs (5 pack B)  are comfy enough to wear long term.Fiancé says they fit great and are very comfortable. They are very soft. Not sure how that will last with washing. Very sexy and comfortable overall.Fit like a charm. Perfect all around and my girlfriend was pleased.Very soft, perfect fitThese were supposed to be one size fits all, yet the tag says medium. I’m not THAT big, but I wear a large. Also, every pair has an itchy tag!!!!!I didn\\'t finds the fabric these are made out of to be comfortable. They do look nice and are smooth under clothes. I\\'m saving them for special occasions. I wouldn\\'t recommend them for daily use.I purchased these for a dozen women of all sizes and shapes as a Galentine\\'s Day party favor. After my guests opened their party gift boxes, they all decided to put these panties on over their clothes as a joke and honestly they fit every single woman in attendance. Super cute, great colors, and truly one size fits all. At this price point, you really couldn\\'t ask for more. Best party favor of all time!Updated review.... Waistband comfortable but definitely not a \"one size fits all\". Tags said medium. After wearing, cannot get past the constant vaginal wedgie. The seam from the waistband cuts your lady-bits right down the middle. Maybe some people like that?? Not me, going to try and return/refund. I would rather wear a hornet\\'s nest over these, the level of comfort is about the same.Definitely not “one size” if you are larger than a small/medium. I’m a Large and they are PAINFUL  by the end of the day. If you are a s/m they would be awesome- but the “one size” is definitely not to fit a range of peopleThese panties are really a great purchase for the money.  They are pretty, comfortable and excellent quality.  Reason why I purchased them is because they have no elastics on the side meaning no elastic band. And they’re great to wear under any pants or jeans without showing any lines. I ordered a second order. Love them!These are super sexy but can be very uncomfortable to wear for long amounts of time.I bought these thinking these were one size fits all...they are a little snug on the waistline. I wear a size 8 usually and they were a little small. You can stretch them to make them work.I\\'ll be perfectly honest. I\\'ve always had a strong dislike of this type of underware. But now I live in leggings and in the past used laser cut sport hipsters and haven\\'t been completely satisfied. They start perfect until I start sweating and then they start bunching at my hips. So I\\'ve been constantly adjusting my pants throughout my workouts.I got fedup and this is what I thought:I purchased a medium instead of my usual small size since I\\'ve read that it can squeeze hip fat. I\\'m a true small so now I\\'ve had these a few months, they\\'ve stretched a little. Still very comfortable and work great but wanted to try the smalls.The smalls are fantastic! I should have gotten my regular size. But now I just use both and I\\'m in love. I wear them everyday!I\\'ll still wear my hipsters for hiking and running outside. For the gym, these are my go to. But for how comfy they are I\\'d wear them everyday regardless of outfit.I HATE wearing thongs. Never been the kind of girl that wears thongs. I have always found them to be extremelt uncomfortable.  I stopped wearing thongs years ago when I finally decided that I wasn’t going to torture myself anymore and just decided to wear regular cotton panties.  While the panties are usually wear are very comfortable, I have “panty lines” on my backside when I wear workout clothes, yoga pants, or leggings (which is all I wear).  My boyfriend pointed out the fact that the panty lines were very visible and since then I’ve became self-conscious.  I started to wear long shirts that cover my backside because I didn’t want my panty lines showing...  after doing that for a while I’ve decided that I would consider wearing thongs again to avoid the panty lines and so I came to Amazon and started reading reviews in hopes of finding thongs that are comfortable.  I am 5‘4“ tall and 136 pounds. I wear a size medium, however, the 6 pack that I wanted to buy was not available in a size medium so I ordered a size small. I received them today.  When I first tried one on and I looked in a mirror I was pretty upset. The size small was small on me (I knew I needed a size medium). Anyways, I thought about returning them but was upset because I knew Amazon was out of the medium size and surprisingly, theae were so comfortable that I wanted to keep them. I took the thing and stretched it. I grabbed one end with one hand and the other end with the other hand and stretched it out as far as it would. Then I tried them on again and BAM! They were no longer small around my wasit! They fitted me perfectly!!! So I decided to keep the small size. These are very very comfy. Feels like wearing nothing at all and no panty lines anymore!!!!! I can see myself wearing these everyday :)I had been on the search for good underwear for running for a very long time. I found this underwear on Amazon a while back and bought a 3-pack, expecting to be disappointed. Boy was I wrong! I became obsessed with this underwear, not just for running, but to wear all the time. A couple days ago, I decided that unless I wanted to continue this endless cycle of doing laundry every three days, I\\'d better buy more. The package just arrived and I\\'m throwing away all my other underwear now.Washed these prior to wearing and the adhesive holding the sides together completely dissolved. This picture  is what I pulled out of the washer.Let me start off by saying that all these amazing reviews -are totally warranted! These are THe best things I’ve ever had; and I’ve bought some pretty expensive ones before! I ended up buying a large bec I bought mediums in a diff brand and while they fit for most part, they did create a line at the waist where they dug in-which made me feel self conscious and muffin-toppy and I didn’t want the same w these happening. And while the large did feel slightly big I was afraid that the mediums would cause same problems as others so i never returned them. However, since I’ve lost a little weight and they are already getting too big to wear soon! I’m going to give it a little more time to lose a bit more and then definitely ordering these in mediums!I wear them esp to the gym now. And let me tell you how amazing it is to NOT have to be worried of wedgies, uncomfortable rubs and just unbreathable panties! I honestly forget that I’m wearing any most of the days!As someone else mentioned, when you look at them they do seem/feel rubbery (like a rubber band) but wearing them is totally different! I’m definitely ordering more of these soon!(written by the wife) I don\\'t love wearing a sports thong to workout but I like not having any lines. I decided to try these, and definitely no lines visible on my workout leggings. They are fairly comfortable for a thong, but I still don\\'t want to wear this all day. It\\'s better than the others I  have tried from Target, and a good price for how many you get in the package.Love these ordered more of them. Great material. Great fit. I did originally order small but next order got extar small to fit a little bit more snug as I notice when you wear throughout the day stretches out a bit and becomes kinda loose. Not a deal breaker but if u are on the skinnier side X\\'s is probably better . It\\'s not that much of a difference from small but enough to be just perfect 👌Underwear is taped poorly and seam came undone first time putting them on.Loved it. Fits amazing and super comfortable. The straps can be removed, the drawstring can be adjusted how much cleavage would you like to create😊.Looks even better than most expensive bras. Highly recommended . PS: I attached photo for you to see the huge difference.I was very hesitant with buying this bra because I didn’t know how to size myself and here’s why:I shop mostly as Victoria’s Secret for bras like this however VS sizes run smaller than normal. I’m a 32C in VS. Anywhere else like target or Walmart example I’m a 32 B. - I got a 32C following the VS sizes I’m used to and normally any other bra I’m not a C because it’s not Vs- but this one had a lot of padding so I decided to order the 32 C to see if maybe the push up would make I\\u200et fit.THIS BRA IS A WONDER BRA. AMAZING. Unlike anything else I’ve bought anywhere. Buy your VS size if that’s what you’re used to.Guys this bra is literally the best thing ever I finally have titties and I can hold things with them now like makeup.Top photo is a 20 dollar store bought push up bra. Bottom photo is this bra. Huge difference. Going to buy a ton more. Also it\\'s comfortable and super supportive. I\\'m a size 34 a btw.\\xa0AMAZING! I was SO skeptical but this bra does exactly what it\\'s supposed to!So I initially followed the listing instructions about ordering a size up but that was way to big so I returned it. Today I received my “normal” size and it actually fits great.Now for why I love this bra - I used to be a hearty C cup for years and years. I could wear a normal non push up bra and have great cleveage, but the last few years I have been dealing with an illness that has taken a lot of toll on my body. I lost 30+ lbs. and have a hard time maintaining any weight gain. Sooo my lush Cs turned into tiny tiny As. None of my cute lingerie fit anymore and I’ve worn bralettes as a replacement, that means NO cleveage. ZERO. I figured finding cute bras to give me any push up was a waste of time because what is there to push up??? Till I found this bra, there was a heart sinking moment when I couldn’t remotely fill the cups of the 34A but the smaller size has answered my prayers! 32A and all the way cinched up I have actual cleveage!!! I can’t believe it! I forgot what that feels like.Now bralettes are way more comfortable no doubt but this is PERFECT for date nights or whenever I want a little boost.Now your tits are certainly not the end all be all of your self worth and that needs to be said. But the ability to transform yourself is one I hold in the highest regard and this bra is an amazing tool for that. This opens me up that there are cute push ups for A cups and I will probably get another one!It is kinda of difficult to find where to adjust the band/straps/tie to give you the best fit, but it does come with an extender. Once you find the best fit, it really does wonders for your boobs.  I did a before and after picture and my friend thought I had gotten a boob job and not told her lolAbsolutely stunning!!! Im so inlove with my new Bra!!! I have always wanted to go a cup size up but now with this amazing bra it looks that way!! I did however buy a size and cup up from what I normally buy.This slimmer was something I purchased to compress my upper hips while wearing work blouses and dresses, and also under my workout clothes. I can feel the stretch in the fabric, but it does not compress enough. I do not think this is a good product for bigger sizes. I bought the XL, and it was too tight in the underwear section, it really cut into my inner thighs.The product looks exactly as the image portrays, and is very soft, and comfortable, aside from the too-tight panty line.I am slightly disappointed with it\\'s weak compression on my waist and the tight panty line, which is why I gave this product 3 stars.I will hold onto this and hope it is more useful when I am able to drop down a few sizes.Great item, and company. I normally wear a size 12. I ordered the large which came in a little too small (I should have used the measurements)... I informed the company it was too small and they shipped me a new one free of charge and allowed me to keep the original one. They were quick to reply and very helpfulI bought this to go under a very tight dress. It did smooth everything I wanted. I am 5’4 and 130lbs and ordered a medium. I could have went with a small.I had ordered an XL, but had to return the item. Their customer service is AMAZING. So helpful. Offering to exchange the item for the correct size. The shape wear is of great quality and material. I\\'d say if you wear a size 14-16, get a Large. It will be tight enough to suck you in, but remain comfortable that you won\\'t even realize it\\'s on.Really nice product, with even nicer customer serviceThis shapewear fits amazingly well. I was reticent to buy based on lack of reviews but am glad I did. The waist comes up high, just below bra line and the low belly support is perfect for fitted dresses. No visible lines. Order a size below what is suggested for the best support.Took the bulge away. Definately slimming.I was always wary to try shaping garments, so this was my first and it honestly surpassed my expectations. I didn\\'t think that these would be anything but a pair of extremely high-waisted underwear but they actually did bring my tummy in enough that I could confidently wear a bodycon dress (which is a HUGE deal for me). I ordered them a size smaller than what I would normally wear as far as panties go, and I do think that that\\'s what did the trick. The only problem I ran into with that was that the non-stretchy lace part was kind of tight and abrasive in the groin area. Otherwise, there was no muffin top and they never once rolled down at the top in all the times that I wore them. I\\'ve lost weight since I ordered these so I definitely plan to order another pair soon!I wear these almost every day over my regular panties. They really hold my tummy in place and give a smaller, smoother appearance. Very strong support, and you can feel the lift in your butt. This is not one of those butt lifters that are supposed to make your butt appear larger, but rather lifts and contours what you already have.I like that it fits to size and is very comfortable.Worth the money and items has a lot of underwear in the pack. You cant go wrong with this. They stretch and had good sturdy fabric and well made. They look like they will last a while.Online showed size 7 which is a large but I received a medium so I returned as soon as I saw size.I ordered these in a size 10, they fit like a 7 or smaller. They also don\\'t stretch much. I\\'m a size 18 in pants. Disappointed because they are a lot  of undies for the price.. the size 10 would fit if you wear a 12 pants.Buena calidad. Suaves y talla ideal. Se las regalé a mi novia con cadera 113 cm. Y le quedaron un poco justas nada grave. Son talla L.Better than VS! Very cute and comfy and you get so many for the priceGood quality and fit just right, thanks!I ordered a large and received a medium.💕💕💕💕💕5’2”, 120 lbs”.  XXL fits good, like a medium/ large.  Not quite hip huggers & since it’s lace, no lines show.Nice sexy but not too sexyGreat item. Beautiful and sexyGood qualityWhen I ordered them, I expected crouchless because that\\'s what it said. They weren\\'t. That being said they are still pretty. I will keep, but am not happy. I don\\'t ever write bad reviews unless absolutely unhappy. I gave a 3 star because panties are pretty and soft. Just not what I wanted.Super cute and sexy. Nice and soft materials. Runs large. I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you. Just didn’t work for my post partum body.First of all, thank you to the company for listing a chart with their sizes in relationship to woman\\'s jean sizes. 🙌 Because let\\'s be honest, I\\'m not going to measure myself, but especially not to buy just underwear. So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front \\'area\\'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: \"Well I didn\\'t have to take these off, which I like, so more\" (He\\'s not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉Super stretchy material. I love these. Try aren\\'t the most amazing thick quality but they will work for the price.These were so sexy and I looked hot in them. I do not wear a 3X, but because they stretch I got a larger size than what I believed I wore. It fit perfectly.I went off other reviews on how they run for size and everything I read said they run small so I ordered a size larger and they are definitely larger.  They weren\\'t too large to go through the effort of returning them but would have been sexier if the fit was better.Bought for my nieces bridal shower . I think she’s going to love them ! It’s for a pantie game they’re playingThese are exactly as pictured. The XL size is a little bit on the snug side but not bad.Wow, I was surprised by this night dress material, it feels really great. When I get home, I will put it on for utmost comfort!!!I can see why this has so many 5 star reviews. The material is extremely soft and comfortable. It isn’t too clingy, it’s the absolute perfect length (short enough to be sexy but long enough to walk in front of the kids in it). My ‘gals’ are a bit too big for the top, but it doesn’t really affect the way the nightgown hits or lays on my body. I probably will order several more of these!well made comfortableGreat details and I am satisfied with this sleep dress. I love the design, it makes me look charming and sexy even at home.I’m 5’11” 155 lbs 34B and the medium fits me perfectly. I love wearing this around the house when it’s just me and my guy. If anyone else is around I throw some shorts on because it come right underneath the booty and stuff still shows. Super comfy and soft material.Absolutely LOVE This product and will be ordering every color they have. It fits perfect and is so soft! Definitely worth the $$ but it takes forever to ship / receive since it’s coming from overseas.Highly recommend!I now own 2 of these sleep shirts.  They are soft, comfortable and cool in summer months.  Plus, they are the right length to where they don\\'t ride up during sleep.  I did have to look up \"Blutentrauma\" which means Beautiful DreamsSuper soft, great fit'"
