# Using Matplotlib and Yahoo Finance API to create AAPL Stock Chart
  Once we have a basic understanding of how Matplotlib works, we might have an interest in taking our knowledge a bit further. Some of the most complex graphing needs come in the form of stock analysis and charting, or Forex.
  
  To acquire the data, we're going to use the Yahoo finance API. This API returns historical price data for the ticker symbol we specify and for the time length we ask for.

## Tools: Matplotlib, Yahoo Finance API, Numpy

## Target: 
  lines, candlestick (using Matplotlib's candlestick function), subplots, volume underneath in another sub plot, RSI indicator, tick label colors, edge / spine colors, line colors, OHLC candlestick colors, learn how to create a filled graph (for volume), histograms, draw specific lines (hline for RSI), and a whole lot more.  

  This data visualization project was inspired by the project “Advanced Matplotlib Series”
